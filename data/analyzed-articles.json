      "content": "As part of its mission to preserve the web, the Internet Archive operates crawlers that capture webpage snapshots. Many of these snapshots are accessible through its public-facing tool, the Wayback Machine. But as AI bots scavenge the web for training data to feed their models, the Internet Archive&#8217;s commitment to free information access has turned its digital library into a potential liability for some news publishers. When The Guardian took a look at who was trying to extract its content, access logs revealed that the Internet Archive was a frequent crawler, said Robert Hahn, head of business affairs and licensing. The publisher decided to limit the Internet Archive&#8217;s access to published articles, minimizing the chance that AI companies might scrape its content via the nonprofit&#8217;s repository of over one trillion webpage snapshots. Specifically, Hahn said The Guardian has taken steps to exclude itself from the Internet Archive&#8217;s APIs and filter out its article pages from the Wayback Machine&#8217;s URLs interface. The Guardian&#8217;s regional homepages, topic pages, and other landing pages will continue to appear in the Wayback Machine. In particular, Hahn expressed concern about the Internet Archive&#8217;s APIs. &#8220;A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Internet Archive&#8217;s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.&#8221; (He admits the Wayback Machine itself is &#8220;less risky,&#8221; since the data is not as well-structured.) As news publishers try to safeguard their contents from AI companies, the Internet Archive is also getting caught in the crosshairs. The Financial Times, for example, blocks any bot that tries to scrape its paywalled content, including bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and the Internet Archive. The majority of FT stories are paywalled, according to director of global public policy and platform strategy Matt Rogerson. As a result, usually only unpaywalled FT stories appear in the Wayback Machine because those are meant to be available to the wider public anyway. &#8220;Common Crawl and Internet Archive are widely considered to be the &#8216;good guys&#8217; and are used by &#8216;the bad guys&#8217; like OpenAI,&#8221; said Michael Nelson, a computer scientist and professor at Old Dominion University. &#8220;In everyone&#8217;s aversion to not be controlled by LLMs, I think the good guys are collateral damage.&#8221; The Guardian hasn&#8217;t documented specific instances of its webpages being scraped by AI companies via the Wayback Machine. Instead, it&#8217;s taking these measures proactively and is working directly with the Internet Archive to implement the changes. Hahn says the organization has been receptive to The Guardian&#8217;s concerns. The outlet stopped short of an all-out block on the Internet Archive&#8217;s crawlers, Hahn said, because it supports the nonprofit&#8217;s mission to democratize information, though that position remains under review as part of its routine bot management. &#8220;[The decision] was much more about compliance and a backdoor threat to our content,&#8221; he said. When asked about The Guardian&#8217;s decision, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle said that &#8220;if publishers limit libraries, like the Internet Archive, then the public will have less access to the historical record.&#8221; It&#8217;s a prospect, he implied, that could undercut the organization&#8217;s work countering &#8220;information disorder.&#8221; The Guardian isn&#8217;t alone in reevaluating its relationship to the Internet Archive. The New York Times confirmed to Nieman Lab that it’s actively &#8220;hard blocking&#8221; the Internet Archive&#8217;s crawlers. At the end of 2025, the Times also added one of those crawlers — archive.org_bot — to its robots.txt file, disallowing access to its content. “We believe in the value of The New York Times’s human-led journalism and always want to ensure that our IP is being accessed and used lawfully,” said a Times spokesperson. “We are blocking the Internet Archive’s bot from accessing the Times because the Wayback Machine provides unfettered access to Times content — including by AI companies — without authorization.” Last August, Reddit announced that it would block the Internet Archive, whose digital libraries include countless archived Reddit forums, comments sections, and profiles. This content is not unlike what Reddit now licenses to Google as AI training data for tens of millions of dollars. &#8220;[The] Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we&#8217;ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,&#8221; a Reddit spokesperson told The Verge at the time. &#8220;Until they&#8217;re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies&#8230;we&#8217;re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.&#8221; Kahle has also alluded to steps the Internet Archive is taking to restrict bulk access to its libraries. In a Mastodon post last fall, he wrote that &#8220;there are many collections that are available to users but not for bulk downloading. We use internal rate-limiting systems, filtering mechanisms, and network security services such as Cloudflare.&#8221; Currently, however, the Internet Archive does not disallow any specific crawlers through its robots.txt file, including those of major AI companies. As of January 12, the robots.txt file for archive.org read: &#8220;​​Welcome to the Archive! Please crawl our files. We appreciate it if you can crawl responsibly. Stay open!&#8221; Shortly after we inquired about this language, it was changed. The file now reads, simply, &#8220;Welcome to the Internet Archive!&#8221; There is evidence that the Wayback Machine, generally speaking, has been used to train LLMs in the past. An analysis of Google&#8217;s C4 dataset by the Washington Post in 2023 showed that the Internet Archive was among millions of websites in the training data used to build Google&#8217;s T5 model and Meta&#8217;s Llama models. Out of the 15 million domains in the C4 dataset, the domain for the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) was ranked as the 187th most present. Andrew DeckOctober 30, 2025In May 2023, the Internet Archive went offline temporarily after an AI company caused a server overload, Wayback Machine director Mark Graham told Nieman Lab this past fall. The company sent tens of thousands of requests per second from virtual hosts on Amazon Web Services to extract text data from the nonprofit&#8217;s public domain archives. The Internet Archive blocked the hosts twice before putting out a public call to &#8220;respectfully&#8221; scrape its site. &#8220;We got in contact with them. They ended up giving us a donation,&#8221; Graham said. &#8220;They ended up saying that they were sorry and they stopped doing it.&#8221; &#8220;Those wanting to use our materials in bulk should start slowly, and ramp up,&#8221; wrote Kahle in a blog post shortly after the incident. &#8220;Also, if you are starting a large project please contact us &#8230;we are here to help.&#8221; The Guardian&#8217;s moves to limit the Internet Archive&#8217;s access made us wonder whether other news publishers were taking similar actions. We looked at publishers&#8217; robots.txt pages as a way to measure potential concern over the Internet Archive&#8217;s crawling. A website&#8217;s robots.txt page tells bots which parts of the site they can crawl, acting like a &#8220;doorman,&#8221; telling visitors who is and isn&#8217;t allowed in the house and which parts are off limits. Robots.txt pages aren&#8217;t legally binding, so the companies running crawling bots aren&#8217;t obligated to comply with them, but they indicate where the Internet Archive is unwelcome. For example, in addition to &#8220;hard blocking,&#8221; The New York Times and The Athletic include the archive.org_bot in their robots.txt file, though they do not currently disallow other bots operated by the Internet Archive. To explore this issue, Nieman Lab used journalist Ben Welsh&#8216;s database of 1,167 news websites as a starting point. As part of a larger side project to archive news sites&#8217; homepages, Welsh runs crawlers that regularly scrape the robots.txt files of the outlets in his database. In late December, we downloaded a spreadsheet from Welsh&#8217;s site that displayed all the bots disallowed in the robots.txt files of those sites. We identified four bots that the AI user agent watchdog service Dark Visitors has associated with the Internet Archive. (The Internet Archive did not respond to requests to confirm its ownership of these bots.) This data is not comprehensive, but exploratory. It does not represent global, industry-wide trends — 76% of sites in the Welsh&#8217;s publisher list are based in the U.S., for example — but instead begins to shed light on which publishers are less eager to have their content crawled by the Internet Archive. In total, 241 news sites from nine countries explicitly disallow at least one out of the four Internet Archive crawling bots. Most of those sites (87%) are owned by USA Today Co., the largest newspaper conglomerate in the United States formerly known as Gannett. (Gannett sites only make up 18% of Welsh&#8217;s original publishers list.) Each Gannett-owned outlet in our dataset disallows the same two bots: &#8220;archive.org_bot&#8221; and &#8220;ia_archiver-web.archive.org&#8221;. These bots were added to the robots.txt files of Gannett-owned publications in 2025. Some Gannett sites have also taken stronger measures to guard their contents from Internet Archive crawlers. URL searches for the Des Moines Register in the Wayback Machine return a message that says, &#8220;Sorry. This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.&#8221; &#8220;USA Today Co. has consistently emphasized the importance of safeguarding our content and intellectual property,&#8221; a company spokesperson said via email. &#8220;Last year, we introduced new protocols to deter unauthorized data collection and scraping, redirecting such activity to a designated page outlining our licensing requirements.&#8221; Gannett declined to comment further on its relationship with the Internet Archive. In an October 2025 earnings call, CEO Mike Reed spoke to the company&#8217;s anti-scraping measures. &#8220;In September alone, we blocked 75 million AI bots across our local and USA Today platforms, the vast majority of which were seeking to scrape our local content,&#8221; Reed said on that call. &#8220;About 70 million of those came from OpenAI.&#8221; (Gannett signed a content licensing agreement with Perplexity in July 2025.) About 93% (226 sites) of publishers in our dataset disallow two out of the four Internet Archive bots we identified. Three news sites in the sample disallow three Internet Archive crawlers: Le Huffington Post, Le Monde, and Le Monde in English, all of which are owned by Group Le Monde. The news sites in our sample aren&#8217;t only targeting the Internet Archive. Out of the 241 sites that disallow at least one of the four Internet Archive bots in our sample, 240 sites disallow Common Crawl — another nonprofit internet preservation project that has been more closely linked to commercial LLM development. Of our sample, 231 sites all disallow bots operated by OpenAI, Google AI, and Common Crawl. As we&#8217;ve previously reported, the Internet Archive has taken on the Herculean task of preserving the internet, and many news organizations aren&#8217;t equipped to save their own work. In December, Poynter announced a joint initiative with the Internet Archive to train local news outlets on how to preserve their content. Archiving initiatives like this, while urgently needed, are few and far between. Since there is no federal mandate that requires internet content to be preserved, the Internet Archive is the most robust archiving initiative in the United States. &#8220;The Internet Archive tends to be good citizens,&#8221; Hahn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the law of unintended consequences: You do something for really good purposes, and it gets abused.&#8221; Photo of Internet Archive homepage by SDF_QWE used under an Adobe Stock license.

The US raid on Venezuela involved bombing across the capital, Caracas, and the killing of 83 people, according to Venezuela’s defence ministry. Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance. Anthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed. Anthropic raises $30bn in latest round, valuing Claude bot maker at $380bn Read more A spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims. The WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims. The US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years. Critics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed. AI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US. This more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”. The Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.

      "content": "My smart sleep mask broadcasts users&#x27; brainwaves to an open MQTT broker 12 Feb, 2026 I recently got a smart sleep mask from Kickstarter. I was not expecting to end up with the ability to read strangers' brainwaves and send them electric impulses in their sleep. But here we are. The mask was from a small Chinese research company, very cool hardware -- EEG brain monitoring, electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes, vibration, heating, audio. The app was still rough around the edges though and the mask kept disconnecting, so I asked Claude to try reverse-engineer the Bluetooth protocol and build me a simple web control panel instead. Bluetooth The first thing Claude did was scan for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices nearby. It found mine among 35 devices in range, connected, and mapped the interface -- two data channels. One for sending commands, one for streaming data. Then it tried talking to it. Sent maybe a hundred different command patterns. Modbus frames, JSON, raw bytes, common headers. Unfortunately, the device said nothing back, the protocol was not a standard one. The app So Claude went after the app instead. Grabbed the Android APK, decompiled it with jadx. Turns out the app is built with Flutter, which is a bit of a problem for reverse engineering. Flutter compiles Dart source code into native ARM64 machine code -- you can't just read it back like normal Java Android apps. The actual business logic lives in a 9MB binary blob. But even compiled binaries have strings in them. Error messages, URLs, debug logs. Claude ran strings on the binary and this was the most productive step of the whole session. Among the thousands of lines of Flutter framework noise, it found: Hardcoded credentials for the company's message broker (shared by every copy of the app) Cloud API endpoints All fifteen command builder function names (e.g. to set vibration, heating, electric stimulation, etc.) Protocol debug messages that revealed the packet structure -- header, direction byte, command type, payload, footer We had the shape of the protocol. Still didn't have the actual byte values though. Claude then used blutter , a tool specifically for decompiling Flutter's compiled Dart snapshots. It reconstructs the functions with readable annotations. Claude figured out the encoding, and just read off every command byte from every function. Fifteen commands, fully mapped. It works Claude sent a six-byte query packet. The device came back with 153 bytes -- model number, firmware version, serial number, all eight sensor channel configurations (EEG at 250Hz, respiration, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope). Battery at 83%. Vibration control worked. Heating worked. EMS worked. Music worked. Claude built me a little web dashboard with sliders for everything. I was pretty happy with it. That could have been the end of the story. The server Remember the hardcoded credentials from earlier? While poking around, Claude tried using them to connect to the company's MQTT broker -- MQTT is a pub/sub messaging system standard in IoT, where devices publish sensor readings and subscribe to commands. It connected fine. Then it started receiving data. Not just from my device -- from all of them . About 25 were active: Sleep masks publishing live EEG brainwave data Air quality monitors reporting temperature, humidity, CO2 Presence sensors detecting room occupancy Claude captured a couple minutes of EEG from two active sleep masks. One user seemed to be in REM sleep (mixed-frequency activity). The other was in deep slow-wave sleep (strong delta power below 4Hz). Real brainwaves from real people, somewhere in the world. EMS The mask also does EMS -- electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes. Controlling it is just another command: mode, frequency, intensity, duration. Since every device shares the same credentials and the same broker, if you can read someone's brainwaves you can also send them electric impulses. Disclosure For obvious reasons, I am not naming the product/company here, but have reached out to inform them about the issue. This whole thing made me revisit Karpathy's Digital Hygiene post, and you probably should too. The reverse engineering -- Bluetooth, APK decompilation, Dart binary analysis, MQTT discovery -- was more or less one-shotted by Claude (Opus 4.6) over a 30' autonomous session. Update: this somehow reached #1 on HN and folks have been asking for the claude conversation transcript. I've added it here . &nbsp;",

Later that year, she married an American citizen and her worries were gone. A Green Card followed, and in 2018, citizenship. Then Shuliak divorced her spouse: a woman named Jennifer who had been in a relationship with Kimbal Musk – Elon Musk’s brother – after Epstein connected them. “now that she’s an american you should throw her a big ole party,” one of Epstein’s go-to immigration lawyers messaged on the day of Shuliak’s naturalisation interview. “with a mechanical bull, red white and blue balloons, and deep fried snickers bars on flag toothpicks”.

The convicted paedophile had arranged for Shuliak’s admission to Columbia University’s dental school, as a transfer student from Belarus who had not finished her degree, via a complicated process that began in 2011.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story Guadalupe, Nuevo León, this week unveiled four robot dogs that will be part of the security devices at BBVA Stadium, one of the three Mexican venues of the 2026 World Cup . The “K9-X” unit functions as a kind of first responder only. The robot dogs are not armed, but each unit incorporates video cameras, night vision, and communication systems that are used to issue warnings or instructions. Its function is to deter illegal activity, detect unusual behavior, identify suspicious objects, control crowds, and immediately alert law enforcement when the system deems necessary. Robot dogs operate semi-autonomously: They do not make decisions or execute movements on their own. Instead, they require an operator to control them as if they were handling a drone or a video game. The operator can even use the robot&#x27;s command system to issue instructions during a crisis. “These K9-X robot dogs are going to support the police with an initial intervention, providing video and ultimately entering high-risk locations—that is, before public security forces go in—and to protect officers’ physical safety, the robots will intervene in the event of a fight or an intoxicated person,” Héctor García, mayor of Guadalupe, said at a press conference. “We have good police officers, and we are working hand in hand with cutting-edge technology for the safety of the people of Guadalupe.” Arrow Arrow The K9-X unit has already made its first official intervention. During the last match of Club de Futbol Monterrey in the Concachampions, the robots patrolled the perimeter of the BBVA Stadium. According to the official press release, the “robodogs” carried out preventive patrols at the entrances and in main gathering areas. The robot dogs are just one part of Guadalupe&#x27;s security strategy for the 2026 World Cup. The city also plans to use advanced surveillance drones and anti-drone technology to protect large events. The authorities have not disclosed the model, manufacturer, or many technical details of the K9-X units. When the World Cup kicks off in June, the BBVA Stadium will host four matches: three in the group stage and one in the round of 16.

The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy under way between the United States and Iran. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned on Saturday ‌that while Trump’s preference was to reach a deal with Tehran, “that’s very hard to do”. Meanwhile, Trump has amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action. Advertisement US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them. Trump, speaking on Friday after a military event at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, openly floated the possibility of changing the government in Iran, saying it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen”. He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, “there are people”. Advertisement “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump said. Trump has long voiced scepticism about sending ground troops into Iran, saying ⁠last year, “the last thing you want to do is ground forces” and the kinds of US firepower arrayed in the Middle East so far suggest options for strikes primarily by air and naval forces.

      "content": "Share Save Share Save Getty Images Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said. Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body. Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said &quot;only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity&quot; to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia. According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as &quot;an information campaign&quot;, but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found. While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Cooper met with Navalny&#x27;s widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend. &quot;Russia saw Navalny as a threat,&quot; Cooper said at the event. &quot;By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,&quot; she added. In the statement the allies said: &quot;Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death. &quot;Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia. &quot;There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny&#x27;s body.&quot; The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia&#x27;s alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny&#x27;s &quot;huge courage&quot;, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said &quot;his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy&quot;. &quot;I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin&#x27;s murderous intent,&quot; he added. Watch: &#x27;Only Russian state had means&#x27; to poison Navalny, says Yvette Cooper French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country &quot;pays tribute&quot; to Navalny, who he suggested was &quot;killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia&quot;. Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia&#x27;s most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47. In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia. Epibatidine, the toxin the UK and its European allies have said was used to kill Alexei Navalny, was first derived from a group of poison dart frogs native to northern South America. Though epibatidine has previously been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lungs, it has been deemed too toxic to use clinically. Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said it was &quot;200 times more potent than morphine&quot;. By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause &quot;muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,&quot; Johnson said. The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, she told the BBC. Researchers believe the frogs acquire it through their diet because animals from different habitats have displayed different levels of the toxin, and those raised in captivity have none. Johnson described it as an &quot;incredibly rare way to poison a person&quot;. She added: &quot;Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.&quot; German Federal Foreign Office via Getty Images Navalny&#x27;s wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by Russia Before Saturday&#x27;s announcement, Navalny&#x27;s wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024. In September last year, Navalnaya said analysis of smuggled biological samples carried out by laboratories in two countries showed that her husband had been &quot;murdered&quot;. She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results. Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: &quot;I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof. &quot;I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,&quot; she added. According to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: &quot;All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West&#x27;s pressing problems.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was &quot;always a sad event&quot;. At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony. According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.

Analysts say Wellington is reluctant to promote any formal agreement with Washington or invite public debate on the issue, even as both governments have confirmed that they are “exploring further opportunities” on critical minerals cooperation. In a joint statement released after a meeting in Washington on February 2, the two sides said they would deepen collaboration on critical minerals, energy, emerging technologies and the digital economy “to ensure economic resilience and mutual prosperity”.

      "content": "WASHINGTON — A NASA test to confirm repairs to seals in the Space Launch System’s liquid hydrogen fueling system was only partially successful because of problems with ground equipment. In a statement late Feb. 13, NASA said it performed a “confidence test” the previous day on the SLS core stage fueling system, partially filling the stage’s liquid hydrogen tank to test seals that had been replaced in a fueling interface. The seals were the suspected cause of hydrogen leaks during a wet dress rehearsal Feb. 2 , when the SLS was loaded with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as part of a practice countdown. The leaks forced an early end to the test, and NASA later said it planned to replace two seals in hydrogen lines that transfer fuel into the rocket. In its latest statement, NASA said the confidence test, not announced in advance and first reported by Spaceflight Now , was intended to evaluate the new seals. However, the agency said that “teams encountered an issue with ground support equipment that reduced the flow of liquid hydrogen into the rocket.” Despite the reduced flow, NASA said it was able to “gain confidence in several key objectives” and collect data at the interface that had been the source of the earlier leak. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman mentioned the test, which he described as a “mini wet dress rehearsal,” during coverage of the Crew-12 launch Feb. 13. “We’re doing a series of mini wet dress rehearsal tests today to make sure we give that vehicle the highest probability of success to get off the pad in early March,” he said during NASA’s webcast of the launch. At a news conference after the launch, Isaacman said program officials wanted to review data from the tests before deciding whether to proceed with a second full wet dress rehearsal. “On Artemis 1, we were combating hydrogen leaks multiple times,” he said. “We obviously encountered that again on the Artemis 2 wet dress rehearsal.” “From some of the early views, we did not see some of the leaks for the portion of the test we were running that at a comparable period during the full Artemis 2 wet dress we did,” he said. He did not mention the reduced flow of liquid hydrogen into the stage, which could affect the ability to fully evaluate the new seals. “We will continue to do everything available to gain confidence going into the full wet dress,” he said. In the new statement, NASA said it plans to inspect the ground support equipment and replace a filter believed to have caused the reduced hydrogen flow. The agency has not announced a date for a second wet dress rehearsal, but Isaacman said there was still time to conduct one ahead of the next Artemis 2 launch opportunity in early March. “We have a lot of time ahead of us,” he said. “We could undertake more than one wet dress, if necessary. We’re going to make absolute most use of the time that we have leading up to the start of the window.” Jeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews.

      "content": "As LLMs become larger, more capable, and more ubiquitous, the field of mechanistic interpretability&nbsp;-- that is, understanding the inner workings of these models -- becomes increasingly interesting and important. Similar to how software engineers benefit from having good mental models of file systems and networking, AI researchers and engineers should strive to have some theoretical basis for understanding the \"intelligence\" that emerges from LLMs. A strong mental model would improve our ability to harness the technology. In this post, I want to cover two fundamental and related concepts in the field (each with their own paper) that I find fascinating from a mathematical perspective: the linear representation hypothesis&nbsp;(Park et al.)&nbsp;and superposition&nbsp;(Anthropic). The linear representation hypothesis (LRH) has existed for quite some time, ever since people noticed that the word embeddings produced by Word2Vec&nbsp;satisfied some interesting properties. If we let $E(x)$ be the embedding vector of a word, then you observe the approximate equivalence $E(``\\text{king\"}) - E(``\\text{man\"}) + E(``\\text{woman\"}) \\approx E(``\\text{queen\"})$. Observations of this form suggest that concepts (i.e. gender in the example) are represented linearly in the geometry of the embedding space, which is a simple but non-obvious claim. There are analogous formulations of the LRH in the two respective spaces. Suppose $C$ represents the directional concept of gender, i.e. male =&gt; female. Then any pairs of input contexts that differ only in that concept should satisfy, e.g. $E(``\\text{Long live the queen\"}) - E(``\\text{Long live the king\"}) = \\alpha \\cdot E_C$ where $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $E_C$ is a constant vector in the embedding space referred to as the embedding representation. Similarly, any pairs of output tokens that differ only in that concept should satisfy, e.g. $U(``\\text{queen\"}) - U(``\\text{king\"}) = \\beta \\cdot U_C$ where $\\beta \\ge 0$ and $U_C$ is a constant vector in the unembedding space referred to as the unembedding representation. Basically, applying the concept has a linear effect in both spaces. The paper goes into much more detail that I'll skip over here, but they show that these representations are isomorphic, which unifies the intervention and linear probe ideas. They then empirically verify on Llama 2&nbsp;that they can find embedding and unembedding representations for a variety of concepts (e.g. present =&gt; past tense, noun =&gt; plural, English =&gt; French) that approximately fit into their theoretical framework -- cool! Okay, so let's assume concepts do in fact have linear representations. Then it would stand to reason that unrelated concepts have orthogonal directions. Otherwise, applying the male =&gt; female concept could influence the presence of the English =&gt; French concept, which doesn't make sense. One of the key results from Park et al. is that this orthogonality doesn't occur under the standard Euclidean inner product but instead under a \"causal inner product\" that is derived from the unembedding matrix. Only by looking at concept representations through that lens do we get the orthogonality we expect. But in these models, the representation space is relatively small (most ranging from 2K to 16K dimensions). So how do these spaces \"fit\" such a large number of language features that far exceeds their dimensionality? It's impossible for all such features to be orthogonal, no matter the geometry. This is where superposition comes into play. In low-dimensional spaces, the intuition is that, when you have $N$ vectors in a $d$-dimensional space with $N &gt; d$, they start to interfere substantially (inner product has a large magnitude). This is one of those examples where low-dimensional intuition does not extend to higher dimensions, however, as evidenced by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. An implication of the lemma is that you can choose exponentially (in the number of dimensions) many vectors that are almost-orthogonal -- that is, the inner products between any pair are bounded by a small constant. You can think of this as the flip side of the curse of dimensionality. The Anthropic paper demonstrates the superposition phenomenon in toy models on small, synthetic datasets. One particularly interesting observation is that superposition does not occur with no activation function (purely linear computation), but it does occur with a nonlinear one (ReLU in their case). The idea is that the nonlinearity allows the model to manage the interference in a productive way. But this still only works well because of the natural sparsity of these features in the data -- models learn to superimpose features that are unlikely to be simultaneously present. In experimental setups where the features in the synthetic data are of equal importance and sparsity, they observe that the embedding vectors learned by the model form regular structures in the embedding space, e.g. a tetrahedron, pentagon, or square antiprism. Coincidentally, these are the same types of structures that I worked with in some old research&nbsp;I did on&nbsp;spherical codes.&nbsp;These structures emerged from using gradient descent-like algorithms to minimize the energy (analogous to that described by the Thomson problem) of arrangements of points on unit hyperspheres. Fun to see the overlap of multiple fields! To conclude, features as linear representations, even if not the complete story, is a valuable framework to help us interpret and intervene in LLMs. It has a solid theoretical basis that is backed up empirically. Sparsity, superimposition, and the non-intuitive nature of higher-dimensional spaces give us a window into understanding how the complexity of language (and intelligence?) gets captured by these models.",

      "content": "Share Save Share Save Reuters Prominent US agent Casey Wasserman is selling his talent company after documents linking him to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were published in the US. Several high-profile clients, including singer Chappell Roan, quit the firm this week after it emerged he flew on Epstein&#x27;s private plane and exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003. Wasserman said in an company-wide email sent on Friday that he had &quot;become a distraction&quot; as he announced he has begun the process to sell the major LA-based agency. The 51-year-old, who has also resisted calls to stand down from his role as chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, previously said he had no &quot;personal or business relationship&quot; with Epstein. &quot;I&#x27;m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,&quot; Wasserman wrote to the agency&#x27;s 4,000 employees in the email, which was obtained by the BBC. He continued: &quot;It&#x27;s not fair to you, and it&#x27;s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.&quot; Wasserman said he &quot;deeply regrets&quot; his discussions with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for facilitating the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Epstein. He said his email exchanges with Maxwell &quot;took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light&quot;. Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein&#x27;s victims and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind. Earlier this week, LA28 said Wasserman would remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers reviewed his past interactions with Maxwell. They found his relationship did not go further than the exchanges that had already been documented and that he had fully co-operated with an investigation. The LA28 board said in a statement that Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein&#x27;s plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2003. The board said the journey was long before &quot;Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell&#x27;s deplorable crimes&quot;. &quot;This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell,&quot; the statement continued. A number of stars have have walked away from Wasserman&#x27;s agency in recent days. Chappell Roan announced that she would no longer be working with Wasserman in an Instagram post on Tuesday. She said: &quot;No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.&quot; Roan did not specifically mention the Epstein-related documents in her statement. Other musical artists have announced their plans to exit Wasserman&#x27;s agency, including country music singer-songwriter Orville Peck, North Carolina-based rock band Wednesday, and singer-songwriter Weyes Blood. Former US football player Abby Wambach also said she was leaving the agency, saying: &quot;I know what I know and I am following my gut and values. I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership.&quot; LA 2028 Olympics chief &#x27;deeply regrets&#x27; flirty emails with Ghislaine Maxwell Casey Wasserman to stay as chair of LA 2028 Olympics after Epstein files fallout Who was Jeffrey Epstein?

      "content": "Share Save Share Save Reuters Travel groups and airlines are warning of potential disruption as the US federal government partially shut down after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) . Several groups, including Airlines for America, said in a joint statement on Friday that without a deal, the risk of unscheduled absences by Transportation Security Administration workers increased, causing flight delays and longer wait times. &quot;Travellers and the US economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay,&quot; they said. A partial government shutdown began at midnight (05:00 GMT) on Saturday after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund DHS operations. In exchange for a funding deal, Democrats had been pushing for more restrictions on US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which will not be significantly affected by the shutdown because of funding from the &quot;One Big Beautiful Bill Act&quot; last year. Democrats have been demanding reforms after federal agents killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good, two Minneapolis residents who were protesting the Trump administration&#x27;s immigration raids in Minnesota, in January. They have asked for a number of changes within the DHS including a ban on immigration agents wearing face masks, better identification for officers and stricter rules for obtaining warrants. On Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked two funding bills because the measures did not include the immigration reforms. The most recent funding measure passed at the end of January only funded the DHS for two weeks while lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attempted to reach a deal on immigration reforms. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said &quot;we&#x27;ll see what happens&quot; when asked by reporters whether he anticipated cutting a deal with Democrats to fund the DHS. &quot;We always have to protect our law enforcement,&quot; Trump added. The shutdown is expected to affect several agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the US Coast Guard and TSA. Last year, the US government saw its longest full shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and led to many federal workers going without pay as well as flight chaos. Democrats at the time were pushing for more health care funding to address rising health care costs. Congress is set to take a recess until 23 February, meaning the shutdown could continue until Trump&#x27;s State of the Union address the following day. However, lawmakers could be called back to Washington earlier if they seem on the brink of a deal. The partial shutdown is unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year&#x27;s because the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic controllers, has already been funded for the rest of the year. But TSA agents - who fall under the DHS - may have to go without pay if the shutdown drags on, meaning people could see longer lines at airports if workers call in sick. The US Coast Guard, which the DHS also oversees, could also be affected. Vice Admiral Thomas Allan told lawmakers that going a few days without funding would mean about 56,000 workers going without pay, leading the agency to suspend missions that were not critical or lifesaving. DHS has $165bn (£120bn) from Trump&#x27;s One Big Beautiful Bill Act - which also included $75bn to fund ICE - that it could use to address some of the funding shortfalls. DHS shutdown looms as funding bill fails over immigration demands Minnesota immigration enforcement surge is ending, Trump border tsar says US government partially shuts down despite last minute funding deal Minneapolis US immigration Donald Trump Air travel US Congress United States",
      "summary": "A potential shutdown of US Homeland Security services could lead to significant airport delays and widespread travel disruption, according to travel groups. This highlights the critical role of federal agencies in maintaining essential infrastructure and services, and the immediate economic and personal impact of political impasses. It underscores the fragility of complex systems when faced with government funding issues.",

SUPPORT ======= Languages: ANSI C, Pascal, Modula 2, Basic. K&amp;R is supported via the ANSI C compiler. Platforms: cpm produces i80 CP/M .COM files em22 produces EM22 bytecode files linux386 produces ELF executables for PC Linux systems linux68k produces ELF executables for m68020 Linux systems linuxmips produces ELF executables for little-endian MIPS32r2 Linux systems linuxppc produces ELF executables for PowerPC Linux systems minix68k produces Minix executables for m68000 Minix systems msdos386 produces i386 MS-DOS 32-bit DPMI .EXE files msdos86 produces i86 MS-DOS .COM files osx386 produces i386 OSX MachO executables osxppc produces PowerPC OSX MachO executables pc86 produces bootable floppy disk images for 8086 PCs pdpv7 produces PDP/11 V7 Unix binaries rpi produces Raspberry Pi GPU binaries INSTALLATION ============ The version 5.0 build mechanism has been completely rewritten (twice). Installation ought to be fairly straightforward. It will build on Unixishes including Linux, OSX, and Windows using MSYS2 and mingw32. Requirements: - an ANSI C compiler. This defaults to gcc. You can change this by setting the CC make variable. - flex and yacc. - GNU make. - Lua (any version) with the lua-posix library installed. - Python 3.4 or above. - about 1GB in the target directory. Instructions: - edit the Makefile. There's a small section at the top where you can change the configuration. Probably the only one you may want to edit is PREFIX, which changes where the ACK installs to, and PLATS, which changes which architectures are built. Look in `plat/*` to see what plats there are. - Run: make ...from the command line. This will do the build. The make system is fully parallelisable by default, but does take a while to start up. - Run: sudo make install ...from the command line. This will install the ACK in your PREFIX directory (by default, /usr/local). The ACK should now be ready to use. USAGE ===== Currently I haven't sorted out all the documentation --- it's supplied in the distribution, but not all of it gets installed yet --- so here is a quickstart guide. The main command to use is 'ack'. This invokes the compiler and the linker. Some useful options include: -m&lt;platform&gt; build for the specified platform -o &lt;file&gt; specifies the output file -c produce a .o file -c.s produce a .s assembly file -O enable optimisation (optimisation levels go up to 6) -ansi compile ANSI C (when using the C compiler) -v be more verbose (repeatable) &lt;file&gt; build file ack figures out which language to use from the file extension: .c C (ANSI or K&amp;R) .b the PDP-11 dialect of B .bas Basic .mod Modula-2 .ocm Occam 1 .p Pascal .o object files .s assembly files .e ACK intermediate code assembly files For further information, see the man page (which actually does get installed, but is rather out of date). There are some (known working) example programs in the 'examples' directory. A sample command line is: ack -mlinux386 -O examples/paranoia.c GOTCHAS ======= There are some things you should be aware of. - Look at plat/&lt;PLATFORMNAME&gt;/README for information about the supported platforms. - The library support is fairly limited; for C, it's at roughly the ANSI C level, and for the other languages it's similar. - When compiling languages other than C, the ACK will usually look at the first character of the file. If it's a #, then the file will be run through the C preprocessor anyway. - BSD systems may need to up the number of file descriptors (e.g. 'ulimit -n 200') before the ACK will compile. - The ACK uses its own .o format. You won't be able to mix the ACK's object files and another compiler's. - The distribution contains *everything*, including the weird, ancient, archaic stuff that doesn't work any more and never will, such as the int EM interpreter and the assembler-linkers. Only some of it builds. Look for build.lua files. DISCLAIMER ========== The ACK is mature, well-tested software, but the environment in which it was developed for and tested under is rather different from that available on today's machines. There will probably be little in the way of logical bugs, but there may be many compilation and API bugs. If you wish to use the ACK, *please* join the mailing list. We are interested in any reports of success and particularly, failure. If it does fail for you, we would love to know why, in as much detail as possible. Bug fixes are even more welcome. The ACK is licensed under a BSD-like license. Please see the 'Copyright' file for the full text. You can find the mailing list on the project's web site: http://tack.sourceforge.net/ Please enjoy.
