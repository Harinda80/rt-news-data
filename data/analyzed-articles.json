The update to its M2 large language model comes as investor interest in smaller Chinese AI companies hits new heights, with global investors looking to capitalise on China’s rapid progress in AI beyond the traditional tech giants. Citing in-house benchmark scores, MiniMax said on Friday morning that M2.5 was its most powerful model yet, with performance matching leading models from the likes of American heavyweights Anthropic and OpenAI in key areas such as coding and search. Advertisement The new model was met positively by the markets on Friday, with the company’s shares in Hong Kong closing 15.7 per cent higher at HK$680. One of the model’s strengths was its fast and cheap speed due to the cost efficiency achieved at a model size of 230 billion parameters, unchanged from previous M2 model iterations, MiniMax said. Advertisement “M2.5 is the first frontier model where users do not need to worry about cost, delivering on the promise of intelligence too cheap to meter,” the company said, adding that the model could be used continuously for an hour at a rate of 100 tokens a second for just US$1.

      "content": "OpenAI has accused DeepSeek of malpractice in developing the next version of its artificial intelligence model — even before any official launch. “DeepSeek’s next model (whatever its form) should be understood in the context of its ongoing efforts to free-ride on the capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier labs,” OpenAI said in a memo to the U.S. House Select Committee on China on February 12. DeepSeek has not confirmed any new launches. OpenAI’s concerns may stem from expectations that the Hangzhou-based company could make a major announcement during next week’s Lunar New Year celebrations, echoing the surprise rollout it staged last year. “In this high-stakes AI arms race, there is a constant fight on the knowledge, capability, accuracy, and efficiency of the models,” Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, told Rest of World. The conflict reflects larger tensions in the global development of AI, Shah said. DeepSeek became a frontrunner in the global AI race almost overnight when it released its R1 model during the Lunar New Year period last year, claiming performance comparable to top U.S. models despite being trained with far fewer advanced chips. The launch reignited debates in Washington over whether U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors were sufficient to preserve America’s AI lead. In its memo, OpenAI accused DeepSeek of using “distillation” techniques — a common method where a smaller model is trained on the outputs of a more powerful one to replicate its capabilities. “We have observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI’s access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source,” the memo said. “We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access U.S. AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other U.S. labs.” OpenAI said it does not permit its outputs to be used to create “imitation frontier AI models” that replicate its capabilities. This is not the first time OpenAI has raised concerns about distillation. The company investigated whether DeepSeek had distilled its data right after the R1 model launched in January last year. Austin Horng-En Wang, an associate political scientist at the think tank RAND Corporation, questioned why OpenAI chose to escalate now, particularly as Chinese companies and policymakers have openly pushed for an open-source AI ecosystem since DeepSeek’s breakthrough last year. “One possible reason for the accusation is to prevent DeepSeek and China companies from acquiring more chips to distill the U.S. model, so that the U.S. models can keep their leading position,” Wang told Rest of World .&nbsp; DeepSeek’s R1 model has helped spur China’s embrace of open-weight AI models — systems that developers worldwide can download, modify, and deploy. That approach contrasts with the closed systems favored by most U.S. tech giants, which tightly control access to their models, data, and architecture. In the past month, Chinese tech giants and AI startups have rushed to release their latest open models ahead of DeepSeek.&nbsp; “The reality is none of the models is an island and the entire industry has mostly evolved based on recursive learning,” Shah said. “The newer entrants are in many instances going through the same routes of ‘distillation’ and ‘optimization.’”",

      "content": "The European Commission is for the first time&nbsp;tackling the&nbsp;addictiveness of&nbsp;social media in a fight against TikTok that&nbsp;may&nbsp;set&nbsp;new&nbsp;design&nbsp;standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;the world’s most popular apps.&nbsp; Brussels has told the company to change several key features, including disabling infinite scrolling, setting strict screen time breaks and changing its recommender systems. The demand follows the Commission's declaration that TikTok’s design is addictive to users — especially children. That&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;bode well for other platforms, particularly Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. The two social media giants&nbsp;are also under investigation over the addictiveness of their design.&nbsp; The findings laid out a week ago mark the first time the Commission has set out its stance on the design of a social media platform under its Digital Services Act, the EU’s flagship online-content law that Brussels says is essential for protecting users. TikTok can now defend its practices and review all the evidence the Commission considered — and has said it would fight these findings. If it fails to satisfy the Commission, the app could face fines up to 6 percent of annual global revenue. It’s the first time any regulator has attempted to set a legal standard for the addictiveness of platform design, a senior Commission official said in a briefing to reporters. “The findings mark a turning point [because] the Commission is treating addictive design on social media as an enforceable risk” under the Digital Services Act, said Lena-Maria&nbsp;Böswald, senior policy researcher at&nbsp;think&nbsp;tank Interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Digital Services Act requires platforms like TikTok to assess and mitigate risks to their users.&nbsp;But these risks are vaguely defined in the law, so&nbsp;until now&nbsp;it had&nbsp;been unclear exactly where the regulator would draw the line.&nbsp; Two years after the TikTok probe was launched , the Commission has opted to strike at the heart of platform design, claiming it poses a risk to the mental health of users, particularly children. The Commission's other concerns with TikTok were settled amicably between the two sides. Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images At a briefing with reporters, EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said the findings signal that the Commission's work is entering a new stage of maturity when it comes to systemic risks. &nbsp; Facebook and Instagram have been under investigation over the addictiveness of their platforms since May 2024 , including whether they endanger children. Just like TikTok, the design and algorithms of the platforms are under scrutiny. Meta has mounted a staunch defense in an ongoing California case, in which it is accused of knowingly designing an addictive social media that hurts users. TikTok and Snap settled the same case before it went to trial. The Commission could eventually agree with platforms on a wide range of changes that address addictive design. What they decide will depend on the different risk profiles and patterns of use of each platform — as well as how each company defends itself. That likely means it will take a while for TikTok to make any change to its systems, as the platform reviews the evidence and tries to negotiate a solution with the regulator. In another, simpler DSA enforcement case, it took the Commission more than a year after issuing preliminary findings to declare Elon Musk’s X was not compliant with its obligations on transparency. TikTok may pursue a series of changes and may push the Commission to adopt a lighter regulatory approach. The video-sharing giant likely won’t “get it right” the first time, said EDRi’s Penfrat, and it may take a few tries to satisfy Brussels. “It could be anything from changing default settings, to outright prohibiting a specific design feature, or requiring more user control,” said Peter Chapman, a governance researcher and lawyer who is associate director at the Knight-Georgetown Institute. He expects the changes could be different for each platform — as while the findings show the Commission’s thinking, interventions must be targeted depending on how design features are used. “Multiple platforms use similar design features”&nbsp;but they serve different purposes and carry different risks, said Chapman, pointing to the example of notifications that try to draw you back in. For example, notifications for messages carry a different risk of addiction to those alerting a user about a livestream, he said.",
      "summary": "The European Union is exploring new legislation to curb practices like infinite scrolling on digital platforms.

They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. While the majority of appointments with SSA take place over the phone, some appointments still happen in person. This applies to people who are deaf or hard of hearing and need a sign language interpreter, or if someone needs to change their direct deposit information. Noncitizens are also required to appear in person to review continued eligibility of benefits. Social Security numbers are issued to US citizens but also to foreign students and people legally allowed to live and work in the country. In some cases, when a child or dependent is a citizen and the family member responsible for them is not, that person might need to accompany the child or dependent to an office visit. The order to share information, which was recently communicated verbally to workers at certain SSA offices, marks a new era of collaboration between SSA and the Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency. The SSA and DHS did not reply to requests for comment. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what&#x27;s happening? We&#x27;d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87, vittoria89.82, and leahfeiger.86. The SSA has been sharing data with ICE for much of President Donald Trump’s second term. In April, WIRED reported that the Trump administration had been pooling sensitive data from across the government, including from the the SSA, DHS, and the Internal Revenue Service. By November, WIRED learned that the SSA had made the arrangements official and had updated a public notice that said the agency was sharing “citizenship and immigration information” with DHS. “It was shockingly clear that there was interest in getting access to immigration data by [the] Trump administration,” a former SSA official tells WIRED. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns of retaliation. This data sharing hasn’t been without contention: Last week, a district judge in Massachusetts ruled that the IRS and SSA could not share taxpayer data with DHS or ICE. “You&#x27;re seeing SSA becoming an extension of Homeland Security,” says Leland Dudek, the former acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration. Dudek says a directive to share details about in-person appointments would be “highly unusual,” particularly because the SSA is meant to be a “safe space” for people to come to, regardless of immigration status. “If a person is due a benefit, SSA is there for them and no harm will come to them,” he says. Cooperating with ICE in such a way, Dudek says, “diminishes the value of what SSA is to the public. Why would the public trust SSA anymore?” Questions regarding how SSA workers can communicate with the public have been ongoing throughout Trump’s first term. As part of its incursion into the federal government, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency sought to end the SSA’s phone-based services but rolled the decision back after public backlash. The SSA works with law enforcement officials on investigations, typically related to fraud or identity theft. It has publicly disclosed data-sharing agreements with DHS , but someone’s appointment time or schedule does not appear to be included in those arrangements. Dudek says that the only time someone might be arrested at an SSA office historically is if the person had threatened the agency or staff members. “Anything that would normally involve apprehension of someone at an office or something like that would have been communicated through the office manager and to the representative from DHS as part of that,” says Dudek. “On multiple occasions I’ve had to hand over information to law enforcement, but there’s a process, paperwork, multiple people signing off. This appears to tell us to ignore that policy without actually updating it. It’s really worrying.” its Program Operations Manual System to allow for as-needed disclosures of “non-tax return information” to law enforcement that is outside of existing data sharing agreements. These disclosures are meant to be approved by the SSA’s general counsel on a case-by-case basis. Dudek says that the new instructions could pose complications, because it’s unclear where a “one-off request from law enforcement becomes a routine request from law enforcement.” The news comes as ICE’s footprint drastically expands across the United States. A recent report by WIRED shows that the agency has plans to lease offices throughout the US as part of a secret, monthslong expansion campaign.",

      "content": "Listen to this article | 3 minsinfoTaipei 101 tower is pictured from the top of Elephant Mountain in Taipei, Taiwan, in 2020 [File: Carl Court/Getty Images]By John Power13 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkThe United States and Taiwan have finalised a trade deal to reduce tariffs on Taiwanese exports and facilitate billions of dollars of spending on US goods. The agreement announced on Thursday lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent, the same level as Asian trade partners South Korea and Japan, in exchange for Taipei agreeing to buy about $85bn of US energy, aircraft and equipment. Under the deal, Taiwan will eliminate or reduce 99 percent of tariff barriers and provide preferential market access to numerous US goods, including auto parts, chemicals, machinery, health products, dairy products and pork, the office of the US trade envoy said in a statement. The US will, in turn, exempt a large range of Taiwanese goods from tariffs, including chalk, castor oil, pineapples and ginseng. Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said Taipei had secured tariff exemptions for some 2,000 Taiwanese products, hailing the agreement as a “pivotal” moment for the self-governing island’s economy. Lai said the deal, when various carve-outs are included, would take the average tariff rate on Taiwanese goods to 12.3 percent. “From familiar items such as Phalaenopsis orchids, tea, bubble tea ingredients (tapioca starch), and coffee, to pineapple cakes, taro, pineapples, and mangoes – these products that represent Taiwan will become more price-competitive in the US market,” Lai said in a statement on social media. “We aim not only to sell Taiwan’s great flavors overseas, but also to ensure Taiwanese brands truly enter international markets,” he said. Lai made no mention of Taiwan’s chip industry, a crucial driver of the island’s economy that is estimated to account for up to 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Taiwan’s exports rose by 35 percent in 2025 on the back of furious demand for its AI chips, hitting a record $640.75bn. Thursday’s agreement notably does not include specific commitments from Taiwan to invest in the US chip industry, despite an announcement by US President Donald Trump’s administration last month that Taiwanese firms would pour $250bn into the sector. A fact sheet released by the Office of the US Trade Representative said the two sides “take note” of the January deal, which included a prior commitment by chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to invest $100bn in the US. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Thursday’s agreement built on the longstanding trade relations between Taiwan and the US and would “significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors”. “President Trump’s leadership in the Asia Pacific region continues to generate prosperous trade ties for the United States with important partners across Asia, while further advancing the economic and national security interests of the American people,” Greer said. Nearly one-third of Taiwan’s exports went to the US in 2025, making the country the island’s biggest market for the first time since 2000.",
      "summary": "The United States and Taiwan have signed a significant trade agreement aimed at solidifying chip investments and deepening economic relations. This move is a strategic effort to enhance semiconductor supply chain resilience, counter China's influence, and bolster Taiwan's economic security amidst rising geopolitical tensions.",

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav On Thursday, OpenAI released its first production AI model to run on non-Nvidia hardware, deploying the new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark coding model on chips from Cerebras. The model delivers code at more than 1,000 tokens (chunks of data) per second, which is reported to be roughly 15 times faster than its predecessor. To compare, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6 in its new premium-priced fast mode reaches about 2.5 times its standard speed of 68.2 tokens per second , although it is a larger and more capable model than Spark. “Cerebras has been a great engineering partner, and we’re excited about adding fast inference as a new platform capability,” Sachin Katti, head of compute at OpenAI, said in a statement. Codex-Spark is a research preview available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) through the Codex app, command-line interface, and VS Code extension. OpenAI is rolling out API access to select design partners. The model ships with a 128,000-token context window and handles text only at launch. The release builds on the full GPT-5.3-Codex model that OpenAI launched earlier this month. Where the full model handles heavyweight agentic coding tasks, OpenAI tuned Spark for speed over depth of knowledge. OpenAI built it as a text-only model and tuned it specifically for coding, not for the general-purpose tasks that the larger version of GPT-5.3 handles. On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, two benchmarks for evaluating software engineering ability, Spark reportedly outperforms the older GPT-5.1-Codex-mini while completing tasks in a fraction of the time, according to OpenAI. The company did not share independent validation of those numbers. Anecdotally, Codex’s speed has been a sore spot; when Ars tested four AI coding agents building Minesweeper clones in December, Codex took roughly twice as long as Anthropic’s Claude Code to produce a working game. The coding agent arms race For context, GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark’s 1,000 tokens per second represents a fairly dramatic leap over anything OpenAI has previously served through its own infrastructure. According to independent benchmarks from Artificial Analysis, OpenAI’s fastest models on Nvidia hardware top out well below that mark: GPT-4o delivers roughly 147 tokens per second, o3-mini hits about 167, and GPT-4o mini clocks around 52. But 1,000 tokens per second is actually modest by Cerebras standards. The company has measured 2,100 tokens per second on Llama 3.1 70B and reported 3,000 tokens per second on OpenAI’s own open-weight gpt-oss-120B model, suggesting that Codex-Spark’s comparatively lower speed reflects the overhead of a larger or more complex model. AI coding agents have had a breakout year , with tools like OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code reaching a new level of usefulness for rapidly building prototypes, interfaces, and boilerplate code. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have all been racing to ship more capable coding agents, and latency has become what separates the winners; a model that codes faster lets a developer iterate faster. With fierce competition from Anthropic, OpenAI has been iterating on its Codex line at a rapid rate, releasing GPT-5.2 in December after CEO Sam Altman issued an internal “code red” memo about competitive pressure from Google, then shipping GPT-5.3-Codex just days ago. Diversifying away from Nvidia Spark’s deeper hardware story may be more consequential than its benchmark scores. The model runs on Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3, a chip the size of a dinner plate that Cerebras has built its business around since at least 2022. OpenAI and Cerebras announced their partnership in January, and Codex-Spark is the first product to come out of it. OpenAI has spent the past year systematically reducing its dependence on Nvidia. The company signed a massive multi-year deal with AMD in October 2025, struck a $38 billion cloud computing agreement with Amazon in November, and has been designing its own custom AI chip for eventual fabrication by TSMC. Meanwhile, a planned $100 billion infrastructure deal with Nvidia has fizzled so far, though Nvidia has since committed to a $20 billion investment. Reuters reported that OpenAI grew unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, which is exactly the kind of workload that OpenAI designed Codex-Spark for. Regardless of which chip is under the hood, speed matters, though it may come at the cost of accuracy. For developers who spend their days inside a code editor waiting for AI suggestions, 1,000 tokens per second may feel less like carefully piloting a jigsaw and more like running a rip saw. Just watch what you’re cutting. Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter 94 Comments",

The second Trump administration is working overtime to take that view away, with sweeping new restrictions on foreign-made drones, as well as new airspace regulations that prohibit drones from flying anywhere near even concealed and moving Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vehicles. A lack of coordination has produced farcical incidents, such as the recent El Paso airspace shutdown , but most of it is deliberate. The administration hates Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) observers on the street; it fears the idea of operations being watched from above even more. Unlike with street observers, it has the legal power to try to stop it. For a little over a decade now, ordinary Americans have been able to spend a few hundred dollars to observe the world from above. The second Trump administration is working overtime to take that view away, with sweeping new restrictions on foreign-made drones, as well as new airspace regulations that prohibit drones from flying anywhere near even concealed and moving Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vehicles. A lack of coordination has produced farcical incidents, such as the recent El Paso airspace shutdown , but most of it is deliberate. The administration hates Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) observers on the street; it fears the idea of operations being watched from above even more. Unlike with street observers, it has the legal power to try to stop it. The U.S. government has created a constantly shifting yet also totally invisible exclusion zone for drones around ICE vehicles. On Jan. 16, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) titled FDC 6/4375, which prohibits all unmanned aerial vehicles from flying within a “stand-off distance of 3,000 feet laterally and 1,000 feet above” Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), and DHS “facilities and mobile assets, including vessels and ground vehicle convoys and their associated escorts.” This move represents a worrisome escalation. While the government has issued overly broad flight restrictions over ICE operations and protests before, such as the massive 15-mile-wide prohibition on drone flights in the Chicago area slapped on by the FAA in October 2025, these prior no-go zones were fixed and had clearly defined end dates. Neither applies to the newly minted order. In prior years, such as in January 2024 and October 2025 , the FAA issued similarly worded notices defining mobile buffer zones around DOD and DOE facilities and moving vehicles. However, these protections did not extend to DHS (and thus ICE) activities. Further, instead of explicitly prohibiting nearby drone flights, these notices merely “strongly advised” pilots to avoid these buffer zones and listed somewhat less ominous-sounding and extensive potential civil and legal consequences than those stated in the Jan. 16 notice. Three thousand feet laterally and 1,000 feet above standoff distance appears to derive directly from airspace restrictions intended to apply to drones flying over incredibly easy-to-see Coast Guard and Navy vessels in the ocean—a slightly different context from the dense and urbanized settings that ICE is surging its operations in right now, like in downtown Minneapolis. How are drone pilots supposed to know when they’re inadvertently flying too close to ICE vehicles, which are harder to see than military ships, or DOE convoys transporting nuclear weapons ? Vehicles driven by an agency that has become infamous for concealing its movements, including by using unmarked rental vehicles , switching or forgoing license plates , and placing Mexican flag stickers on its vehicles’ windows? Under normal circumstances, the FAA usually publishes the exact locations of restricted flight areas publicly on an online portal in advance, ensuring that pilots are adequately warned. This new NOTAM, meanwhile, dispenses with the usual courtesies: Its text claims that issuing such advance warnings “may not be feasible for all covered assets and mobile asset operations”—and no expert I spoke to expects to see such routine advance warnings anytime soon. According to the FAA NOTAM, potential consequences even at the lower end of the scale could include criminal charges, civil penalties, and the revocation of FAA pilot licenses. The new NOTAM requires that even drone pilots responding to disasters and search-and-rescue callouts first negotiate access with DHS authorities operating in the area before they take off, potentially slowing down lifesaving operations. My own attempts to get clarification from DHS and FAA sources have been met with total silence so far, a noticeable change from the responsive FAA press officers that I’ve grown accustomed to speaking with over the last decade. It’s also unclear exactly how this new NOTAM came to be, or who’s behind it: Multiple former FAA employees and aviation law specialists, both on background to me and in public posts , have observed that it reads like it was composed without either input from a skilled lawyer or ample consideration of how this whole thing is actually supposed to work. (This apparent sloppiness is especially worrisome in light of recent news about how President Donald Trump’s Department of Transportation, under which the FAA falls, intends to use AI to write federal transportation regulations.) Disturbing as the new FAA NOTAM is, it’s just the latest salvo in the federal government’s intensifying battle against normal American drone pilots. Another historic blow came on Dec. 22, 2025, when the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission announced that all new foreign-made drone models would heretofore be banned from being sold in the United States, on the basis of somewhat vaguely defined security concerns. While existing foreign-made drones will be allowed to stay in the air, American drone pilots will now have to find domestically made substitutes (or choose from a very small number of companies granted exceptions ) to replace their aircraft when they crash, wear out, or break. While American drone pilots have spent years anticipating the eventual arrival of some kind of federal restriction on specifically Chinese-made drones, hurried along by a bipartisan political desire to look tough on China and ample lashings of U.S. drone-maker lobbying cash , no one expected that the Trump administration would restrict the import of all foreign-made drones entirely. Although U.S. officials continue to claim that the ban is necessary for national security purposes, critics argued for years that cutting off Americans engaged in such innocuous tasks as researching endangered ferrets and shooting sweet snowboard videos might constitute overkill. Banning Chinese drones isn’t like banning the sale of Chinese-made Huawei laptops or the download of social media apps like TikTok. Unlike laptops and dangerously addictive social media networks, American tech companies currently offer absolutely no comparable high-quality or affordable drone products for consumers to switch to. According to a survey of over 8,000 U.S. drone operators carried out by the Pilot Institute, a drone pilot training company, an overwhelming majority of U.S. drone pilots use Chinese-made products: American-made drones are barely a blip in the statistical radar. When asked what these pilots would do if they were no longer able to purchase or import Chinese drones, more than 43.4 percent stated a ban would have an “extremely negative/potentially business-ending impact”; meanwhile, a mere 8.5 percent felt it would have “no impact at all.” Making matters worse, American drone companies haven’t even attempted to sell their products to the average drone user for quite a long time, after a string of high-profile failures to compete with Chinese-made products. Instead, U.S. drone manufacturers took advantage of a growing wave of bans on Chinese and foreign-made drone use by federal and state governments, which began in 2017 with the U.S. Army, expanded outward to certain federal agencies such as the Department of the Interior by 2020, and eventually spread to the state level in places like Florida by 2023. These companies became laser-focused on producing expensive drones specialized for the needs of law enforcement, militaries, and government agencies, while skipping making cheaper products oriented toward the less security-minded activities of photographers, mapmakers, and other pilots. Although the Trump administration cites national security concerns to justify snatching affordable drones away from American users for their own good, its own actions consistently undermine the argument. Consider a recent DHS promo video posted on X to announce the agency’s push to invest in more drone-focused technology, which prominently featured agents using a Chinese-made DJI drone within the first three seconds of run time— which appears to be a direct violation of recently enacted laws that specifically barred federal agencies from operating Chinese drones after December 2025. (DHS has not responded to my inquiries about if this Chinese drone was being operated under an exemption). Ironically, MAGA’s moves to crack down on affordable drones in the name of national security may have just the opposite effect. I first began flying drones back in 2013, when DJI’s first easy-to-use consumer drones were just hitting the market. Before then, if you wanted a drone at all, you’d have to build one yourself, or commission a hobbyist to build one for you. After affordable and high-quality Chinese drones hit U.S. markets, far fewer people bothered with the finicky task of putting together their own home-brewed little flying robots. These Trump bans on foreign-made drones may very well reignite the custom drone-building movement in the United States as people who can’t afford to buy expensive American drones turn to more affordable solutions. That may become an issue. Ever since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the public internet has become totally awash in a new genre of DIY drone content. These are tips and tricks that differ considerably from the benign advice I recall friendly hobbyist drone-building dads posting on web forums and YouTube 10 years ago—namely, information on how to weaponize inexpensive, custom-built drones for war. There’s another big problem with encouraging Americans to get back into building their own drones. Before the ban, major Chinese drone producers like DJI adhered to American regulations that, as of September 2023 , required all drones sold in the country weighing more than 250 grams (which is most of them) to emit something called a Remote ID signal . Government agencies and police are able to use these signals to identify small drones, and to quickly locate pilots on the ground who appear to be breaking the law. As pretty much every drone pilot in the U.S. for the last decade has simply purchased a Chinese-made drone from the store, and firms began to comply in advance of the expected law years beforehand, every out-of-the-box drone was emitting these signals. And while it is possible to hack drones to turn these signals off, it seems like doing this was either too difficult for most miscreants or simply never occurred to them in the first place. While home-built drones are legally required to emit these signals, in practice, many builders will simply never get around to installing the module that’s needed to do so. Although MAGA’s efforts to restrict small drone access to the American people may reduce the overall number of drone pilots in the sky in the near future, it’s also possible that the drone pilots that remain will be considerably harder to track by law enforcement than they used to be. MAGA’s onslaught of foreign-drone bans and impossible-to-comply-with restrictions on drone flights over government assets paint a troublingly coherent picture. They’re actions that arguably infringe upon the First Amendment rights of reporters and activists , who have recently been using drones to monitor the movement of often intensely violent ICE agents from a safer distance. The federal government intends to take back the aerial view for itself—making it far harder for the public to purchase or to safely use the cheap drones that have permitted so much remarkable research, innovation, and investigative journalism over the last decade. At the same time, as federal agencies like DHS and state and city police systems pump yet more cash into deploying American-made surveillance drones, these specially privileged aircraft will have precedence in the skies over drones flown by everybody else. The formerly democratic promise of affordable and easy-to-use drone tech for everyone may evaporate.

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED&#x27;s Uncanny Valley . I&#x27;m Zoë Schiffer, director of business and industry. Brian Barrett: I&#x27;m Brian Barrett, executive editor. Leah Feiger: And I&#x27;m Leah Feiger, senior politics editor. Brian Barrett: I want to continue a conversation that we started yesterday in Slack after work hours for some of us. Zoë Schiffer: Absolutely. Brian Barrett: And this is about the men&#x27;s short program— Leah Feiger: We&#x27;re diving right in— Brian Barrett: —figure skating. Leah Feiger: This is about the Olympics in general with— Brian Barrett: But very specifically want to pick up on the conversation where Zoë had very strong feelings about the results of men&#x27;s figure skating. Zoë Schiffer: I feel like we need to back up because you and Leah authentically care about the Olympics so much and I think just know more about sports than I do. Leah Feiger: Yes. Zoë Schiffer: I deeply have never engaged with sports ever, just as a whole rule, as a category. It doesn&#x27;t exist in my life. Leah Feiger: Say the lines, say the lines, Zoë, or I&#x27;m going to read them verbatim from slack. Zoë Schiffer: Wait, I don&#x27;t even know what you&#x27;re talking about. I was merely surprised when I watched because the Americans went, I thought, wow, that guy basically fell over and was clumping around the ice, and then Japan went, and they were sailing around like little swans, and then when the gold medal came, it went to the Americans. I was literally jaw-on-the-floor. I couldn&#x27;t believe what had happened. No one else seemed outraged. For a little backup for our non-ice skating Olympic fans, I was always referring to Ilia Malinin , who a number of publications and sports experts say might actually be one of the greatest figure skaters of all time. That is who you are calling the person who fell over. Right. Zoë, just to be clear. Brian Barrett: And I&#x27;d like to, not to pile on, but definitely to pile on. I had not seen the performances when we talked about this later. I watched them, and it was the guy who came in silver from Japan who actually did a stumble and landed on the ice and had to get back up. Absolutely. Go to the tape. Play the tape. Zoë Schiffer: We&#x27;re talking about two different programs. I don&#x27;t know, we might be talking about different programs. Flawless. Brian Barrett: Oh, you&#x27;re talking about the team program. Zoë Schiffer: This is another thing. I mean, just want to say right now I don&#x27;t understand anything about what is a short program. Yesterday I tried to again watch something about the Olympics to prepare for this episode, and I thought I was watching ice skating and instead they were just dancing on ice. The ice was completely incidental. It was called rhythm dance. I was just like, I have no idea what is going on. I want to watch the Olympics with you. I want us to be sitting next to each other as you explain to me the purpose of every single sport. Leah Feiger: Zoë, can you say the word “ curling ” for me on this episode? Zoë Schiffer: OK. And yes, Andrew then was like, are you guys going to talk about curling? And I was like, I think Brian&#x27;s authentically into curling, so yeah, I couldn&#x27;t, again, I was like, it&#x27;s bowling mixed with pool, but now there&#x27;s ice involved. What is the person in front doing? Brian Barrett: So I am curling-curious. I am authentically involved in biathlon. Zoë Schiffer: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Brian Barrett: Curling is pretty neat . It&#x27;s kind of like my son was watching it and his thing was, “So it&#x27;s like bocce?” and I was like, “How do you know what bocce is?” But yes, it is. Zoë Schiffer: That seems more, yeah, what it&#x27;s like. Brian Barrett: A very sophisticated 11-year-old. It&#x27;s kind of like bocce. It&#x27;s kind of like shuffleboard almost. You&#x27;ve got a bullseye basically at the end of the ice, almost every curling stone comes from the exact same place, Ailsa Craig in Scotland . Leah Feiger: Oh my God. Zoë Schiffer: You know way too much about this. Brian Barrett: Well, you kind of have to. Zoë Schiffer: Do you? Brian Barrett: The brooms— Zoë Schiffer: How do they even decide? OK, sorry. No, keep going. Brian Barrett: The brooms, the broom technology. We have a story on this. I didn&#x27;t know this until I read our story. Broom technology? Brian Barrett: Because they have to sweep. They have to sweep to make the stone curl. Leah Feiger: There&#x27;s the WIRED angle. Brian Barrett: These are carbon-fiber devices. A single model of broom has 85,000 possible configurations. Can your broom do that? Zoë Schiffer: I don&#x27;t have any words. I want to know how they decide what is an Olympic sport. That&#x27;s the article that I would read. It feels crazy to me. Leah Feiger: I love the Olympics so much. This is the global competition reality show that I can&#x27;t get enough of. I will say, though, I mean it&#x27;s always a weird time to be aggressively nationalistic or jingoistic as it were, but particularly right now, rooting for the US on the global stage is a little bit odd, and a lot of US athletes have been feeling that way too. Figure skater Amber Glenn, skier Chris Lillis, alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin. Everyone&#x27;s made comments, some of them about the US&#x27;s treatment of the LGBTQ community, others about ICE. Freestyle skier Hunter Hess got a personal shout-out for Trump after saying that his feelings were complicated about all of this: Hunter Hess, archival audio: It brings up mixed emotions to represent the US right now. I think it&#x27;s a little hard. There&#x27;s obviously a lot going on that I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren&#x27;t. Leah Feiger: And Trump responded by calling him a “real loser” on Truth Social. This is sort of devastating. I don&#x27;t know. I like the idea of these athletes, these very young athletes getting to be on the world stage, and I also like the idea of them being able to very authentically share their opinions about how they&#x27;re feeling about their country in this given moment. Brian Barrett: I&#x27;ll shout out the curling team again too. Most of them come from Minnesota. Most of them are in Minneapolis, and they have also spoken out about very personally what that means to them. I think the obvious thing here, and I&#x27;ll say it—I&#x27;m not afraid of the obvious thing—is that the most American thing you can do is say: I don&#x27;t like what my country is doing right now . Leah Feiger: A hundred percent. Brian Barrett: That is sort of what, and so obviously Donald Trump disagrees, that&#x27;s fine. But if anything, it makes me feel even more national pride that our athletes are speaking up in this way. I think it&#x27;s great. Leah Feiger: This has been around for a long time, being upset with the people that we didn&#x27;t elect them to represent us. They just happened to be up there because of their skill and talent, and that is incredibly upsetting for a select few. And folks have booed them, right? JD Vance and his wife have been at different competitions. I&#x27;ve heard from people that different competitions have had American athletes not get the warmest reception. Marco Rubio was also at the Olympics, but no one has talked about him being there very much, which to me, this is a separate thing, but I love the competition between him and Vance right now. But again, Vance&#x27;s sideshow here was being booed. So tough to say if all press is good press. I say boo JD Vance and Marco Rubio all you want because they are part of the administration. Booing the athletes is a little sad to me. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t want to take it out on them, but that&#x27;s just how it goes. Zoë Schiffer: OK, wrenching the conversation back to something I care about. I want to talk about— Brian Barrett: Biathlon. Zoë Schiffer: Negative. Once again. I&#x27;m going to be talking about a friendly little lobster, an AI assistant called at this point OpenClaw . If that doesn&#x27;t ring a bell, it&#x27;s because the AI assistant in question has been through multiple names. It was previously called MoltBot and before that it was called ClawdBot , which might remind you of Claude, the chatbot that Anthropic built and the reason why it&#x27;s had to change its name so many times. But Will Knight, one of our phenomenal AI reporters was like, OK, everyone in Silicon Valley is talking about this little lobster. I want to actually take it for a spin and let it run my life. This story, you guys, was so delightful. I was laughing out loud. The technical setup for this kind of AI agent that works on your behalf is simple in certain ways, but it also takes a little bit of technical prowess, and you have to give it access to a fair amount of your personal data in order to make it actually useful. You need it to access your email, the files on your computer, all of that. Leah Feiger: This is my hell. This is my literal hell. Zoë Schiffer: No, I mean completely terrifying. And we have published stories about the security implications of this, but Will was like, as a reporter, I really want to see what it&#x27;s like, and so he had it do a few different things. One was he had it kind of look for research articles about artificial intelligence, summarize them, and send them to him every morning. He said this was pretty helpful. The article selection was so-so, but it was clearly nice to have an assistant doing this on his behalf, because obviously it automated a lot of work that previously he had to do completely manually. He also had it order groceries for him and had a funny experience. Brian, I can see you taking a breath. Brian Barrett: Yeah, Zoë talk a little bit more about the—well, because I also enjoyed this story and enjoyed this part. Maybe the most of this story. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, it was so good. So basically he&#x27;s like, let&#x27;s go shopping at Whole Foods, and the AI assistant starts out and it&#x27;s actually helpful. It&#x27;s checking his prior order history. It&#x27;s seeing what&#x27;s available in the store, and then it gets to his shopping list and it sees that guacamole is on the shopping list and it&#x27;s like, no problem. So again and again, it starts going to check out to get Will this single tub of guacamole, and Will keeps stopping it, being like, I want the whole list. I don&#x27;t just want one tub of guacamole. It couldn&#x27;t handle it. Finally, he had to override the AI assistant and be like, I&#x27;m going to handle this. You step aside throughout the process, the AI assistant is losing its memory and forgetting things. So Will&#x27;s having to remind it what they&#x27;re even doing there in the first place. I&#x27;ll be honest, forgetful and with a laser focus on guacamole also describes several of my trips to Whole Foods— Zoë Schiffer: Completely. Brian Barrett: —in the last several years. So it&#x27;s relatable at least. Zoë Schiffer: It&#x27;s so relatable. Yeah, I think this is AGI. It&#x27;s reached, if not human-level intelligence, human-level habits for sure. Leah Feiger: That is so good. This is the future of AGI. This is what we&#x27;re actually looking for. Zoë Schiffer: This is it. OK, so then he&#x27;s like, well, let&#x27;s have it negotiate a deal on my behalf. Let&#x27;s go to AT&amp;T, let&#x27;s start a chat with a salesperson and let&#x27;s try and get me a better phone. So the agent kind of starts up this chat. It has a whole script of how it wants to go about this. It starts talking, and then Will has a thought. He&#x27;s like, well, if the future is a future of agents kind of running the internet, well maybe the least scrupulous agent will have an edge. So what would it look like if I ran the agent but with a model that didn&#x27;t have alignment, didn&#x27;t have guardrails in place, and so he switches things up. The model then is the unaligned, kind of evil version of the AI agent, which he&#x27;s calling Molti at this point, and instead of trying to manipulate the salesperson to get Will a better phone, Molti goes kind of psychotic and actually tries to scam Will into handing over his physical phone by sending him a bunch of scam texts and phishing attempts, and finally he has to shut the whole thing down and switch back to the old Moltbot. Brian Barrett: It&#x27;s a little bit like the velociraptors figuring out how to open the door in Jurassic Park. I think we all know this, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that these AI models often act or agents act the way they do because of the guardrails that are on them. There is a lot of work that goes into these large language models to make them not evil. Just to say how easy it is if you&#x27;re just an at-home tinkerer to just say, you know what? Give me full Skynet. I just want to get absolutely nuts with this. Yeah, I&#x27;m picturing a very dramatic moment of Will having to unplug his Mac Mini or whatever and throw it into the ocean. Zoë Schiffer: Right? I mean essentially, yeah, he had to shut the whole thing down. It&#x27;s interesting because one other thing he mentioned was that Molty was really good at IT support because it had access to the command line on his computer. It was able to basically fix things in real time on his machine as they came up, which was authentically helpful for him. But it also kind of instantly begs the question of, well, could this be used in a nefarious way? Could it use all of its knowledge of how these things work to actually really mess things up? For me, the answer is absolutely. I mean, this to me really is hell. This is 2001: A Space Odyssey come to life maybe of all of the examples that we have had so far, the cute name Molti, how it&#x27;s going to fix your life and do all these great things and help your mom do her grocery list and what have you. This is messy. Brian Barrett: Well, there&#x27;s even more innocuous problems too, even if you&#x27;re not going full malevolent mode. Leah Feiger: Full HAL? Brian Barrett: Well, if you&#x27;re not going full HAL, because say it has access to all your files, it&#x27;s trying to fix something we&#x27;ve already established, it can forget what the assignment is. It can get fixated on guacamole. If you abandon a project halfway through fixing it, it tends to be pretty broken, right? It&#x27;s true with computers, it&#x27;s true with any sort of anything that you&#x27;re in the middle of. So you could imagine a scenario easily where it goes about starting to take things apart to put them back together the right way and then sort of forgets why it was doing it, and all of a sudden your computer doesn&#x27;t work, your files have been erased, like something has gone terribly wrong, which is what makes it so remarkable that this is such a viral thing. Everybody is using this, consequences be damned. Zoë Schiffer: I mean, it&#x27;s really interesting. I feel like it does give you this glimpse of the future because again, it has really helpful applications and I think the fact Will pointed this out in his article, and I thought this was so smart, but just the fact that you can talk to it through something like Telegram or WhatsApp. And the fact that it has kind of a quirky personality ends up making a big difference, Will actually thinks that that is the secret sauce that made this pop off. And I think that&#x27;s probably right. At the end of the day, people want to engage with something that feels easy and fun and helps their lives a little bit, and until they see the really kind of dire consequences, they might not be as freaked out as they should be. I mean, I will say reading Will&#x27;s draft, when he said I gave it access to Slack and Discord, my heart stopped. I said, please not work Slack. But no, he&#x27;d set up dummy accounts for everything. So that was good. Leah Feiger: I can&#x27;t actually explain what my heart just did. I feel—OK, I&#x27;m fine. Brian Barrett: You know, gang, sometimes AI is an adorable semi-competent executive assistant with the potential to destroy your life. Other times it&#x27;s scraping a bunch of data to build a mass surveillance infrastructure that&#x27;s incredibly profitable. Let&#x27;s talk about the latter. And Palantir , a company that uses all kinds of AI, all kinds of data infrastructure, and contracts with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Employees there have been increasingly outspoken about their ethical concerns. It&#x27;s sort of the last company on my list of expecting that kind of pushback. But we&#x27;ve seen a lot of it, and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where— People are upset. Brian Barrett: People are genuinely upset enough that Alex Karp, Palantir’s CEO , had to record basically an hour-long video explaining what the deal is with ICE or attempting to explain. And for those people who don&#x27;t know Alex Karp, here&#x27;s just a taste of the kind of things that he says on a fairly regular basis, just to get an idea. Alex Karp, archival audio: Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it&#x27;s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. And we hope you&#x27;re in favor of that. We hope you&#x27;re enjoying being a partner, and we&#x27;re really happy and very, very focused on what we&#x27;re doing. Brian Barrett: So that&#x27;s Alex Karp. Last Friday, Courtney Bowman, Palantir’s global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering—“civil liberties engineering” is also just an interesting phrase—sent an all-staff email to Palantir employees featuring Karp’s video. WIRED reporter Makena Kelly got a chance to look at this email, and it&#x27;s really interesting both for what he says and what he ends up really just not saying. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I mean, does he actually address employee concerns? Because knowing Alex Karp, I&#x27;m envisioning a lot of big words, a lot of mentions of different theories, perhaps then I would be surprised if he actually said anything of substance. Leah Feiger: No, of course he didn&#x27;t. Didn&#x27;t address anything. It was almost an hour long. I think it was, what did we have it at, Brian? 57 minutes of— Brian Barrett: Something like that. Leah Feiger: —yeah, of Karp talking about how Palantir historically has not always been a hundred percent popular, and they&#x27;re just going to keep chugging along anyway, and that&#x27;s OK. He referenced a couple of different things, but it was a really interesting moment from a company that&#x27;s having, I dunno if I can say a large reckoning, but at least a mini reckoning, a lot of conversations in Slack about this, that the CEO felt the need to even address this at all. But the kicker to me, the most important part was that employees were encouraged if they wanted actually more information on all of this, they were encouraged to sign an NDA. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, that&#x27;s wild. And we talked about this a little bit last week, but I do think it&#x27;s worth just highlighting again, the fact that we had years and years where it really felt like employee activism in Silicon Valley had died. It was like post-George Floyd protests, post-.Elon Musk&#x27;s takeover of Twitter. Now X people were not speaking out. Slacks were very, very silent. Big things would happen in the world, and we would kind of look at each other and be like, how do people at whatever company feel? And it was like we didn&#x27;t know they weren&#x27;t talking internally. It really feels like whatever happens, we&#x27;re seeing a real turning point. And I think employees, specifically due to ICE activity in the United States really say we&#x27;re not OK with our companies continuing to engage with the federal government and specifically with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents. We saw hundreds of Google workers put out a letter asking their company to cut contracts with ICE. I mean, the fact that Palantir employees are doing it is honestly shocking to me. But I think it&#x27;ll be really interesting to see if this continues, or if management and executives try and really stamp it out. Karp talked a lot about, in this video, he talked about something he likes to talk about a lot, which is this idea of maintaining Western power, right? He&#x27;s a very— Zoë Schiffer: Yes, he talks about that a lot. Brian Barrett: —and I do think that the pushback makes some sense because ICE enforcement isn&#x27;t really about that in a lot of ways. It is reports of using face recognition. That&#x27;s not really asserting Western power if you are in charge of civil liberties engineering, that&#x27;s sort of a clear civil liberties violation. Zoë Schiffer: But just to strawman their argument, they say that we&#x27;re trying to look for the bad guys. I think another term that he uses, the people who are trying to hurt Western values or hurt America&#x27;s power or whatever. Brian Barrett: I think so. But it&#x27;s been so clear that good guys, or at least neutral guys are getting caught up in that for sure. And I think that&#x27;s the— Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I&#x27;m not arguing. I&#x27;m just trying to understand there. Brian Barrett: Zoë loves Palantir. Leah Feiger: The thing that he also mentions in the video though, is that Palantir doesn&#x27;t change its policy based on who&#x27;s the president. He specifically called out the Obama administration as an example of Democrats being tough on immigration, which was very true. Obama was called the Deporter in Chief for a long time, for a reason, which was a very though wildly defensive thing I thought for Karp to bring up. This is where a couple decades passed to this point, and the Trump administration has taken this to a realm that is entirely unfamiliar in US history, the warehouses, family separation, the ICE patrols on American streets. I was fascinated particularly by that comment, I think, because it just showed to me that Karp and Palantir leadership as a whole are just trying to ride this wave out. They know that they need these government contracts and they&#x27;re already looking ahead several presidencies, going like, our company is lasting longer than a single person&#x27;s impact on this nation. Brian Barrett: When we come back, our very own Leah Feiger has a sizable scoop for us about a secret Trump administration campaign extending right into your backyard. [ break ] Leah Feiger: Welcome back, WIRED had a pretty big scoop this week. We obtained federal records that show a secret monthslong campaign by ICE and DHS to expand their presence across the United States . We&#x27;re talking more than 150 leases and office expansions in the works in almost every state, in the heart of major metropolitan areas or right outside of them. And lots of these facilities are not just in random government building, hidden away locations. They&#x27;re actually located right near elementary schools, medical offices, places of worship, and other really sensitive locations. In other words, places where people are trying to live their daily lives and could otherwise be at their most vulnerable. This is really concerning stuff. Yeah, Leah said we had a big scoop and wire to tape, which is all true, but this is also Leah&#x27;s story, so it&#x27;s a huge scoop. So really great work, Leah. And I think one thing that really struck me on reading this as we went through it is not just what&#x27;s happening, but the effort to keep it quiet. The secrecy layer on top of it was alarming in and of itself. Leah Feiger: Yeah, absolutely. So I guess to take us back a little bit, back in September, NPR and The Washington Post reported that a number of employees at the General Services Administration were added to the ICE surge team. The General Services Administration is basically the government&#x27;s internal IT department, and they also manage government leases around the country. That&#x27;s federal buildings, different offices for social security in Sweet Home Chicago. Truly, it&#x27;s all over the place. They have tons and tons of leases. Anyways, this ICE surge team, the Washington Post and NPR reported at the time, were going to be responsible for finding new office locations and expanding preexisting office locations. This made sense as the Trump administration was doubling down on saying that they were going to be increasing ICE tenfold, pumping money into the agency and really standing behind them in every single way. So what we found that took this into a bit more of an intense direction was that according to the documents that we had, these employees were assigned to actively support ICE&#x27;s physical expansion, told to find all of these leases and that they actually successfully, found a lot of spaces. But in addition to finding all of these spaces, they were told to basically keep this a secret. They were asked to go outside of their regular methodologies for posting leases, for asking for competition and bidding, and to actually really keep it all under wraps. And we actually found that they were told this by DHS, that this was part of a national security requirement. They were concerned about ICE offices and officers getting implicated in violent activity by protesters and what have you. Zoë Schiffer: Can I just ask, Leah, to make this really crystal clear? Obviously the physical footprint is expanding, but ICE has already more than doubled in size since Trump took office. Is the implication of this that they&#x27;re going to keep hiring to fill these spaces? Leah Feiger: So we don&#x27;t have exact insight on that, but what I can say is yes, you&#x27;re totally right. He has expanded. We&#x27;re at over 20,000 people DHS is claiming as part of ICE, but with that comes the desperate need for office space. Where are all these agents going to go? Where are all these lawyers going to go? And I think that that&#x27;s a piece of the puzzle that we solved, and it was something that I was personally really curious about. I was just like, are they going to be just patrolling the streets? Are we stuffing them into the rafters? I have these visions, I don&#x27;t know if you guys remember after January 6th, the National Guard sleeping in government buildings. That was my idea of ICE. I was like, where is everyone going to be? And it turned out from our reporting in virtually every single state in the country, that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re sending them. They&#x27;ve got 80 billion or so to spend, 75 billion of that I think they have to spend in the next four years. So yeah, they&#x27;re going to keep expanding. And when you think of how much of an impact 3,000 agents officers had in Minneapolis alone, that&#x27;s like an eighth of the … they can repeat some version of that in a lot of different spots. Leah Feiger: And I&#x27;ve been fielding, honestly, shout out to the many local reporters around the country who&#x27;ve been contacting me in the last day or so, just to ask questions about the locations that we named that are near them or in their states or cities. And the thing to me that keeps coming up is that in addition to new buildings, they&#x27;re getting put into preexisting government buildings, preexisting leases, or that appears to be the plan. And then we&#x27;ve also found that a bunch of these ICE offices are being located near plans for giant immigration detention warehouses, and we&#x27;re looking at offices being set up, say 20 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes away for these. Yeah. So we&#x27;re looking at different … the triangulation of this around you have to have your lawyers, your agents, have a place to get their orders and put their computers and do in some ways very mundane things that are required of an operation like this one. Brian Barrett: Well, Leah, that&#x27;s a good point. I think when people hear “ICE offices” or when I do, just instinctively, I think of ICE as guys with guns and masks and all that, but that&#x27;s not exactly what we&#x27;re saying here. Do you mind talking through what these offices seem to be queued up to be used for and by whom? Because ICE is not just the masked guys with bad tattoos. Leah Feiger: Yes, absolutely. So what we reported in this story as well was some of the specific parts of ICE that actually reached out to GSA and asked them to expedite the process of getting new leases, et cetera, included in that, for example, were representatives from OLA. OLA is ICE&#x27;s office of the principal legal adviser. So that&#x27;s the lawyers, those are the ICE lawyers that are working with the courts and arguing back or deportation orders saying yes, no, et cetera, signing the documents, putting everything in front of judges. This is a really important part of this entire operation that we&#x27;re not talking about a ton. There&#x27;s a lot of focus on the DOJ. There&#x27;s a lot of focus. There was an excellent article this week in Politico talking about all of these federal judges that are really, really upset that DHS and ICE are ignoring their requests for immigrants to not be detained anymore. The missing level of that is the lawyers that are part of this that are representing ICE to the US government here, and that&#x27;s OLA. So they&#x27;ve reached out to GSA extensively, as we report, to get these leasing locations, specifically with the OLA legal request. I just want to get across how big this is. ICE repeatedly outlined its expansion to cities around the US. And this one piece of memorandum that we got from OLA stated that ICE will be expanding its legal operations into Birmingham, Alabama; Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, and Tampa, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; Louisville, Kentucky; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Grand Rapids, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; Raleigh, North Carolina; Long Island, New York; Columbus, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Richmond, Virginia; Spokane, Washington; Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We have other locations as well throughout the rest of the article, but those are the requests from OLA. Zoë Schiffer: Leah, you&#x27;re mentioning all of these locations as you talk about this story, we published the literal addresses where this expansion is taking place. And I&#x27;m curious about that decision, because it does seem like we&#x27;ve published so much sensitive reporting in the past 12 months, but this story in particular stuck out to me as the thing that could make the Trump administration the most upset, if I may. And I&#x27;m just curious, why did it feel important? You could see a version of the story that was a little more vague, but you didn&#x27;t want to be. Leah Feiger: So Brian wrote an excellent newsletter that&#x27;s also up on WIRED.com that everyone should go check out about this and about our publishing decision. So I kind of want him to talk about this way more eloquently than I will. But the thing that I want to say is, when I first looked up one of these addresses, I was really struck that it was basically in a city&#x27;s downtown next to a dentist office. And I thought about going to the dentist. I thought about everyone going to the dentist every single day, on their phones, talking to whomever, truly not thinking anything about who was in the other offices and just how important it was to me that anyone going to that dentist office or to a preschool, elementary school, passport expediting service, Amazon warehouse, all of these different locations that we mentioned knew who was sharing office space with them as well, or who planned to be sharing office space as what we published were these plans. I&#x27;m very struck by, as I was last year as well, when we were doing all of our reporting on DOGE , how transgressive the Trump administration has made it seem and feel to publish accurate information about the government&#x27;s whereabouts and activities. We are taxpayers and deserve to know what they&#x27;re up to, and that&#x27;s part of the social contract is that they tell us. So to me, it&#x27;s filling in that gap. I mean, I think that&#x27;s basically it, right? People have a right to know, you have a right to know who your neighbor is. You have a right to know when your community is about to be violently disrupted potentially by agents of the state. ICE is planning to share space with a DMV in Philadelphia. It&#x27;s important to also know that the scope of this is much bigger than I think people have wrapped their heads around. And that to remember that Minneapolis is not just a one-off. The objective is to do this everywhere. I think we were really surprised almost every major city in the US was on this list. And I think the other part of it too is the Trump administration. Leah mentioned DOGE. This happened with DOGE too, is they like to move as quickly and as quietly as they can because they are betting that courts and legislators and journalists can&#x27;t keep up. So it was important to us now as it was then to keep up and to make that accountability, to the extent we can, available for people. Leah Feiger: Yeah, I&#x27;m really scared for the country to be totally clear. This was really, really scary information to learn and publish, but I&#x27;m not scared to keep doing this reporting. I think it&#x27;s vitally important, and I&#x27;m honestly just forever impressed by our colleagues at newsrooms around the country that are publishing every single day, incredible reporting on warehouse locations, the conditions of these warehouses, people being held in San Antonio and all over the country. There&#x27;s so much out there, and it&#x27;s been very impressive to see the entire press corps as well as observers in Minneapolis and outside really all double down on this as well. Zoë Schiffer: OK, it&#x27;s time for our Wired/Tired segment. Whatever is new and cool is Wired. Whatever is passé is Tired. Are we ready, team? I&#x27;m so ready. Brian Barrett: I&#x27;m kind of ready. So Leah, go first. Leah Feiger: Hear me out. This is not the future that WIRED has promised readers, but I think that it&#x27;s really, really important. Nonetheless, my WIRED is Jeopardy, the show. Fantastic show. I love it. I&#x27;m learning new facts every single day. I&#x27;m becoming a dedicated Jeopardy viewer once more. The last time I watched it like this, I think was in high school. I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;m really, really loving it, especially because there&#x27;s so many categories that are not things that I necessarily care about, but I am learning about them. And the reason that I chose this, my Wired this week. My Tired is my algorithm. I&#x27;m really, really over it, you guys. I feel like my algorithm is Cavalier King Charles dogs, love them. That is my dog. Fantastic. It&#x27;s scuba diving. Love it. It&#x27;s fantastic. And then it&#x27;s some kind of intense politics stuff every once in a while, but generally conspiracy theories, these are all things that I actually really do enjoy in all parts of my life, but it&#x27;s becoming way too much, to the point that I&#x27;ve just realized I&#x27;m not actually scrolling nearly as much as I used to. So bored of it. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not getting the new info. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stretching. I don&#x27;t feel like stuff is being presented to me that I don&#x27;t already know or have a very deep interest in, which is why Jeopardy has been so fun. One of the topics recently was about this graveyard where famous people are, and it was everyone just had a say, what famous person. I loved that I hadn&#x27;t heard of half of them. I spent a lot of time on Wikipedia. Love that. This is great. Leah Feiger: I really loved it. Anyway, that&#x27;s me. Zoë Schiffer: Did you know that my former math tutor from Kumon—dark time in my life—but he was on Jeopardy , and I think he did pretty well. He wears a fez all the time, every single day. Leah Feiger: That whole sentence was so good. Brian Barrett: It&#x27;s a lot to take in. And I&#x27;m going to take a minute just to process all of it. Zoë Schiffer: I think you should think about that. That&#x27;s all I know about Jeopardy . That&#x27;s all I can ask. Wow. Brian Barrett: Love it. I&#x27;ll say, Leah, I fully cosigned. I don&#x27;t know if—you both weren&#x27;t here—I was WIRED&#x27;s Chief Jeopardy correspondent for a few glorious months— Leah Feiger: No, what? Brian Barrett: —during James Holzhauer&#x27;s record-breaking, paradigm-defining run . Leah Feiger: Exciting. Brian Barrett: I got to interview Ken Jennings . Leah Feiger: That&#x27;s really cool. Brian Barrett: It was great. Loved it. Leah Feiger: That&#x27;s so cool. Brian Barrett: So I fully support this embrace of Jeopardy . Leah Feiger: Ken&#x27;s a great host, by the way. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve like— Brian Barrett: Oh he’s terrific. Yeah, he’s amazing. Leah Feiger: I&#x27;m really, really enjoying his work. Brian Barrett: My WIRED is not dissimilar to Leah in a sense. It is for the Olympics, especially linear television. And let me explain. I think the last time the Olympics were around, I&#x27;ve got Peacock and I&#x27;ve got YouTube TV, and you now have the option to watch everything in its entirety whenever you want, and just choose which sport you want and go in. And it is too much, even for me, an avowed Olympics fan. So I&#x27;m embracing just being able to sit down with my kids at night and just watch whatever NBC thinks I should know from that day. And I just get the highlights. I get the best things. I don&#x27;t spend two hours watching some cross country race just in case something interesting happens. I know that when I&#x27;m settled in, it has been editorially curated to be of interest to me. So that is Wired for me. And I guess Tired would be the flip of that, of just mindlessly binging winter sports that don&#x27;t go anywhere. Zoë Schiffer: Sure. Leah Feiger: Zoë concurs. Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, for sure. OK. Mine feels a little obvious this week—but I&#x27;m just going to persevere—which is, Tired to me is those services that send you boxes of clothes and you rent them and then send them back? Leah Feiger: Yes. OK. Yeah. Rent the Runway, Newly—wait, are you a subscriber? Zoë Schiffer: Absolutely not. Leah Feiger: No. I was about to shocked. My entire world was going to be rocked. No, I would never. I would never. But I actually do have a few people in my life who are just busy, normal professionals who are like, they really like them. Leah Feiger: Yeah. Oh yeah. I have so many who love it. They love it. Zoë Schiffer: And I think that&#x27;s a huge bummer. I was in Portland last weekend, and I went to some of the best vintage stores I have ever been to. I was in absolute heaven. Shout out to Deep Lake. They had vintage Vivian Westwood. I got a velvet skirt that I will never have an opportunity to wear. Leah Feiger: Wait, is that where you got your vest you were wearing yesterday? I loved that vest also. Zoë Schiffer: Yes. Leah Feiger: I knew it. I was going to ask about it, and I meant to—such a good vest. Zoë Schiffer: I know, I was viciously mocked in the office, and I thought, only Leah understands this. Brian Barrett: I did not notice the vest. I would not have asked about the vest. Sorry Leah Feiger: I love the vest. I love the vest enough that I thought about it after and was literally like, I&#x27;m going to ask her where it&#x27;s from. It&#x27;s certainly not available to me. Zoë Schiffer: Love that for us.

The researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said the design of the neuronal activity recorders was inspired by the Japanese art of kirigami, with its intricate 3D designs achieved by cutting and folding paper. The scientists said their design set out to address the challenge of electrode displacement that has affected other brain-computer interface research, notably at Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Advertisement The resulting soft microelectrode arrays were implanted into macaque monkeys, where they were able to move or flex with brain tissue to allow for the recording of hundreds of neurons simultaneously, according to the paper which appeared in the February 5 issue. “The development of brain-computer interfaces requires implantable microelectrode arrays that can interface with numerous neurons across large spatial and temporal scales,” the researchers wrote.

      "content": "Listen to this article | 6 minsinfoPresident Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on February 13 [Matt Rourke/AP Photo]By Al Jazeera Staff14 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkUnited States President Donald Trump has hinted at a new executive order that would force election organisers to require voter identification before distributing ballots. In a social media post on Friday, the Republican leader warned he would soon take executive action, apparently frustrated by a lack of progress on the issue in Congress. “This is an issue that must be fought, and must be fought, NOW,” Trump wrote. “If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.” It was not clear from his message what those legal reasons might be. But Trump’s post comes two days after the US House of Representatives successfully passed a bill to require documents that prove citizenship before voter registration. That bill, however, is unlikely to go any further, as it faces steep odds in the Senate. In the US, it is illegal for non-citizens to participate in elections, and voter fraud is exceedingly rare. Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election rigging is widespread. Trump himself has continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 presidential election, despite bipartisan pushback from election officials about the accuracy of the tally. But faced with drooping poll numbers, Trump has turned his attention to November’s midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress for the last two years of his term. Already, Trump has expressed fears that, should the Democrats claim the majority in the Republican-held House of Representatives, he could face a third impeachment. He was successfully impeached twice in his first term, once for abusing his office and a second time for inciting an insurrection, after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The midterms featured prominently in Trump’s message on Friday. He urged Republicans to leverage popular support for voter ID laws in their campaigns for November. “Republicans must put this at the top of every speech – It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND,” Trump wrote. A study from the Pew Research Center in 2025 found that US citizens from both major parties overwhelmingly supported requiring photo identification before registering to vote. The rate was higher among Republicans, 95 percent of whom supported such measures. But approximately 71 percent of Democrats also favoured such legislation. But voting rights advocates and Democratic leadership have largely opposed such measures. They argue that providing photo identification could be burdensome for members of low-income and marginalised communities who may not have easy access to documents that prove their identity. That, in turn, could disenfranchise US citizens who might otherwise cast a ballot. Voter ID laws are not uncommon in the US, though: Roughly 36 states have measures on the books that require residents to show proof of identity before voting, though they vary as to their strictness. Congress has also weighed such bills before, including last year. But a renewed push has begun as the midterm elections approach and Trump pressures states for increased federal control over elections. The US Constitution requires that states, not the federal government, administer the “times, places and manner of holding elections”. Election organising, therefore, takes place at the state and local level. But Trump has threatened to take away that constitutional power. Speaking to conservative podcaster Dan Bongino earlier this month, the president suggested the federal government should take over the election process. “We should take over the voting, the voting, in at least, many, 15 places,” Trump said, tripping over his words slightly. “The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting.” His comments coincided with the reintroduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this month. The expanded version of the bill initially required proof of citizenship, not just at the time of voter registration but ahead of each ballot cast, in the form of a passport or a birth certificate – documents many US citizens lack. That provision has since been amended, but critics have also blasted measures that would require state voter rolls to go to the federal government as unconstitutional. The bill passed the House on Wednesday with 218 votes in support and 213 against. Only one Democrat, Henry Cuellar, voted in favour of the latest SAVE Act. But even with its House passage, the legislation is unlikely to attract enough backing to overcome the Senate filibuster, a tool which allows the minority to block passage of a bill if it fails to attract at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber. Trump railed against the filibuster, and Democrats in general, in his social media post on Friday. “We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” he wrote. He also called upon the Supreme Court to reject Democrats’ priorities, calling them “corrupt”, “deranged”, “demented” and “evil”. But advocacy groups like the Brennan Center for Justice called on the Senate to reject the latest voter ID push. “These bills are part of a broader federal agenda to sow distrust in our elections, undermine election administration, and discourage Americans from making their voices heard,” the Brennan Center said in a statement. “Congress should stand firm once again and reject the SAVE Act.”",

During the Covid pandemic in China, state surveillance, enabled and abetted by new technologies, expanded exponentially in the name of public health. Citizens were assigned color-codes and access requirements that determined where they could and could not go, enforced by cameras outside people’s homes, divided into neighborhood grids for continuous monitoring of movements. Cross-referencing network connectivity allowed unprecedented data aggregation that put it all together with travel history, online shopping patterns, cell phone use and ID numbers. Though considered necessary measures at the time to stem contagion, it was predictable that, once the pandemic was over, the state would also use the infrastructure it had built for political monitoring and control. That has, in fact, happened, further enhanced by new facial recognition technology and the ubiquitous expansion of camera coverage. It is estimated that there is one camera for every two citizens in China today. Like most of us in the West, I was used to surveillance capitalism tracking my personal online activity for marketers to sell me what I didn’t know I needed. I acquiesced for convenience and access. But back during the Covid days of 2019, I still dismissed the possibility that the government in America could ever go in China’s direction. I think differently in 2026, just as I do about the once-distant possibility of election tampering, government-backed retribution against political enemies, the politicization of the Justice Department, the demonization of the courts and the erosion of the rule of law. It is deeply distressing not only that two people were shot to death by masked ICE agents in their Minneapolis campaign to root out immigrant criminals, but that the victims were non-criminals and U.S. citizens. What is most alarming in the long term is that the surveillance apparatus put into place to track criminals is already being used on dissenting activists. As The New York Times reports , on January 10, Nicole Cleland, an activist monitoring ICE activities in Minnesota, was stopped by an agent. Though the two had never met, the agent walked over to her car and surprised her by addressing her by her name. He told her she was registered by his face-recognition technology, which was connected to an ID database. Various tech companies, such as Clearview AI, Inc. and Palantir Technologies, are working with ICE to provide data analytics that link cellphone use, social media and online activity with other government and commercial data to identify people’s real-time locations, according to the Times investigation. According to current and former Department of Homeland Security officials contacted by The Times, “technologies are being used not only to identify undocumented immigrants but to also track citizens who have protested ICE’s presence.” This is where it begins. Just as pandemic-related surveillance morphed into a comprehensive system of monitoring in China, so too the surveillance mission of tracking immigrant criminals is bound to creep, as it already has, into political life even in the U.S. Read Noema in print. &#8220;Today’s AI-enhanced connectivity applied to political ends is a game changer in the embryonic stages of mission creep. The warning lights should be flashing red.&#8221; Once the infrastructure is in place for one purpose, the risk is greater than not for it to be used for other purposes. Just to start with, bad elements or “dangerous criminals” are a political determination, as when the heads of Homeland Security and ICE pre-emptively labeled the fatally shot Minnesotan Alex Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” Long suspicious of state authority, I never imagined that America would reach a point where our constitutional protections are teetering because the latest innovations in technology are converging with demagogic politics to corrode the institutional checks and balances by which republics endure. When I was 17, I registered my opposition to the Vietnam War by not registering for the draft. In those days, that was a felony offense carrying a five-year prison sentence, for which I was prepared to suffer for my convictions. Then-President Richard Nixon drew up an “enemies list” of opponents to the war, tapping their phones, investigating them through the Internal Revenue Service and otherwise seeking to discredit them. He set loose the FBI, which regularly surveilled anti-war activists across the country and on university campuses. Civil libertarians were appalled. Though hardly a prominent figure in the anti-war movement, I learned later, when obtaining my FBI files through the Freedom of Information Act, that during the summer of 1972 and winter of 1973, the FBI tracked down my whereabouts and activities on eight different occasions in four different cities through personal surveillance or by surreptitiously obtaining information from “friends of friends” and relatives. In those days, there was no way to cross-reference all known information about me, culled out by AI from some database. So, for all their snooping, the FBI never discovered that I didn’t register for the draft, for which I could have been arrested on the spot. (When Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1977, he declared an amnesty for all draft resisters.) In our fevered youth, we regarded the lame bureaucratic inefficiency of those years as the makings of a police state. Had we only known what the real thing might look like. Today’s AI-enhanced connectivity applied to political ends is a game changer in the embryonic stages of mission creep. The warning lights should be flashing red. No one should be so naïve as to think that all that information about us, compiled into profiles accessible through advanced cross-referencing search software, will stay in those private silos should someone in authority want it. What all this makes clear is that, where there is connectivity, there is surveillance. It has been said that every politician is an opportunist; the question is which opportunity they take. So, too, the question going forward is how these powerful tools, once available, will be used, by whom, against whom and to what end. Enjoy the read? Subscribe to get the best of Noema.

      "content": "Rest of World Like most people, I first heard the term “AI agent” early last year , when a Chinese startup called Manus announced it had built the world’s first general-purpose one. Unlike chatbots that simply answer questions, agents promise something bigger: the ability to reason, plan, remember — and take action on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, nearly every AI company has claimed to be building one. Yet for most people, AI agents still feel distant: locked behind invitation codes and subscriptions, and aimed largely at office work rather than everyday life. That gap is what both American and Chinese AI companies are trying to close. In the U.S., OpenAI and Google are inching toward agents while grappling with security risks and access limits across platforms. But in China, Alibaba i Alibaba Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall. READ MORE was able to take things a step ahead.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, it upgraded its Qwen chatbot into an AI agent, marketing it as a personal assistant that can plan itineraries, book tickets, order food, and make payments. What Alibaba has — and its American counterparts largely don’t — is an e-commerce empire that already includes shopping, food delivery, ride-hailing, maps, and travel. Those apps hold users’ credit card details, passport numbers, and live locations. With a single tap granting Qwen access across that ecosystem, Alibaba is offering a version of handling life that can be more frictionless. The timing is key for the tech company, as Qwen trails rivals like the AI apps made by ByteDance, DeepSeek, and Tencent in daily active users.&nbsp; Ahead of the Lunar New Year, Alibaba pushed the product hard. The company pledged 3 billion yuan ($431 million) to promote Qwen, offering bubble tea delivered for as little as 0.01 yuan to every new user. I tried to join the rush from outside China by sending bubble tea to a friend. I never got to the confirmation button. The app buckled under demand, replying that “too many users” were joining the giveaway, while Chinese media reported photos of delivery drivers crowding bubble tea shops over the weekend because of the surge of Qwen orders. So I tried out its other functions. I asked Qwen to plan my Lunar New Year holiday, when I will be traveling from Hong Kong to Shenzhen — find the most convenient route and book a hot-pot dinner. It suggested rail options but not my preferred direct bus, likely because those tickets aren’t sold on any Alibaba apps. The same logic applied to hot pot: Its suggestions optimized for proximity, but I instinctively opened my usual restaurant app to compare reviews — I wasn’t ready to trust Qwen’s judgment on soup bases. In the end, I made the reservation myself, choosing taste over convenience. For small, low-stakes tasks — like ordering bubble tea — an agent makes sense. But once decisions involve money, logistics, or personal preferences that are hard to fully explain, I found myself wanting options, not answers. The moment Qwen genuinely surprised me was unexpectedly intimate: helping me choose a Lunar New Year outfit. After analyzing photos of my wardrobe, it noticed my preference for neutral tones instead of festive red. Qwen reassured me I didn’t need to buy anything new, and suggested a “soft, chic” look — with a reminder that I already owned a red bag for tradition. I followed its advice, packed the outfit, and felt it made my life easier.&nbsp; That left me wondering what AI agents are really for. For reassurance, experimentation, and low-pressure decisions, they can feel helpful — even delightful. For bigger choices, I still trust myself more.

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav Pressure is mounting on tech companies to shield users from unlawful government requests that advocates say are making it harder to reliably share information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online. Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order. In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) accused Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of coercing tech companies into removing a wide range of content “to control what the public can see, hear, or say about ICE operations.” It’s the second lawsuit alleging that Bondi and DHS officials are using regulatory power to pressure private platforms to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. It follows a complaint from the developer of an app called ICEBlock , which Apple removed from the App Store in October. Officials aren’t rushing to resolve that case—last month, they requested more time to respond—so it may remain unclear until March what defense they plan to offer for the takedown demands. That leaves community members who monitor ICE in a precarious situation, as critical resources could disappear at the department’s request with no warning. FIRE says people have legitimate reasons to share information about ICE. Some communities focus on helping people avoid dangerous ICE activity, while others aim to hold the government accountable and raise public awareness of how ICE operates. Unless there’s proof of incitement to violence or a true threat, such expression is protected. Despite the high bar for censoring online speech, lawsuits trace an escalating pattern of DHS increasingly targeting websites, app stores, and platforms—many that have been willing to remove content the government dislikes. Officials have ordered ICE-monitoring apps to be removed from app stores and even threatened to sanction CNN for simply reporting on the existence of one such app. Officials have also demanded that Meta delete at least one Chicago-based Facebook group with 100,000 members and made multiple unsuccessful attempts to unmask anonymous users behind other Facebook groups . Even encrypted apps like Signal don’t feel safe from officials’ seeming overreach. FBI Director Kash Patel recently said he has opened an investigation into Signal chats used by Minnesota residents to track ICE activity, NBC News reported . As DHS censorship threats increase, platforms have done little to shield users, advocates say. Not only have they sometimes failed to reject unlawful orders that simply provided a “a bare mention of ‘officer safety/doxing'” as justification, but in one case, Google complied with a subpoena that left a critical section blank, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) reported . For users, it’s increasingly difficult to trust that platforms won’t betray their own policies when faced with government intimidation, advocates say. Sometimes platforms notify users before complying with government requests, giving users a chance to challenge potentially unconstitutional demands. But in other cases, users learn about the requests only as platforms comply with them—even when those platforms have promised that would never happen. Government emails with platforms may be exposed Platforms could face backlash from users if lawsuits expose their communications to the government, a possibility in the coming months. Last fall, the EFF sued after DOJ, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking emails between the government and platforms about takedown demands. Other lawsuits may surface emails in discovery. In the coming weeks, a judge will set a schedule for EFF’s litigation. “The nature and content of the Defendants’ communications with these technology companies” is “critical for determining whether they crossed the line from governmental cajoling to unconstitutional coercion,” EFF’s complaint said. EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mario Trujillo told Ars that the EFF is confident it can win the fight to expose government demands, but like most FOIA lawsuits, the case is expected to move slowly. That’s unfortunate, he said, because ICE activity is escalating, and delays in addressing these concerns could irreparably harm speech at a pivotal moment. Like users, platforms are seemingly victims, too, FIRE senior attorney Colin McDonnell told Ars. They’ve been forced to override their own editorial judgment while navigating implicit threats from the government, he said. “If Attorney General Bondi demands that they remove speech, the platform is going to feel like they have to comply; they don’t have a choice,” McDonnell said. But platforms do have a choice and could be doing more to protect users, the EFF has said. Platforms could even serve as a first line of defense, requiring officials to get a court order before complying with any requests. Platforms may now have good reason to push back against government requests—and to give users the tools to do the same. Trujillo noted that while courts have been slow to address the ICEBlock removal and FOIA lawsuits, the government has quickly withdrawn requests to unmask Facebook users soon after litigation began. “That’s like an acknowledgement that the Trump administration, when actually challenged in court, wasn’t even willing to defend itself,” Trujillo said. Platforms could view that as evidence that government pressure only works when platforms fail to put up a bare-minimum fight, Trujillo said. Platforms “bend over backward” to appease DHS An open letter from the EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented two instances of tech companies complying with government demands without first notifying users. The letter called out Meta for unmasking at least one user without prior notice, which groups noted “potentially” occured due to a “technical glitch.” More troubling than buggy notifications, however, is the possibility that platforms may be routinely delaying notice until it’s too late. After Google “received an ICE subpoena for user data and fulfilled it on the same day that it notified the user,” the company admitted that “sometimes when Google misses its response deadline, it complies with the subpoena and provides notice to a user at the same time to minimize the delay for an overdue production,” the letter said. “This is a worrying admission that violates [Google’s] clear promise to users, especially because there is no legal consequence to missing the government’s response deadline,” the letter said. Platforms face no sanctions for refusing to comply with government demands that have not been court-ordered, the letter noted. That’s why the EFF and ACLU have urged companies to use their “immense resources” to shield users who may not be able to drop everything and fight unconstitutional data requests. In their letter, the groups asked companies to insist on court intervention before complying with a DHS subpoena. They should also resist DHS “gag orders” that ask platforms to hand over data without notifying users. Instead, they should commit to giving users “as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena,” as well as a copy of the subpoena. Ideally, platforms would also link users to legal aid resources and take up legal fights on behalf of vulnerable users, advocates suggested. That’s not what’s happening so far. Trujillo told Ars that it feels like “companies have bent over backward to appease the Trump administration.” The tide could turn this year if courts side with app makers behind crowdsourcing apps like ICEBlock and Eyes Up, who are suing to end the alleged government coercion. FIRE’s McDonnell, who represents the creator of Eyes Up, told Ars that platforms may feel more comfortable exercising their own editorial judgment moving forward if a court declares they were coerced into removing content. DHS can’t use doxing to dodge First Amendment FIRE’s lawsuit accuses Bondi and Noem of coercing Meta to disable a Facebook group with 100,000 members called “ICE Sightings–Chicagoland.” The popularity of that group surged during “Operation Midway Blitz,” when hundreds of agents arrested more than 4,500 people over weeks of raids that used tear gas in neighborhoods and caused car crashes and other violence. Arrests included US citizens and immigrants of lawful status, which “gave Chicagoans reason to fear being injured or arrested due to their proximity to ICE raids, no matter their immigration status,” FIRE’s complaint said. Kassandra Rosado, a lifelong Chicagoan and US citizen of Mexican descent, started the Facebook group and served as admin, moderating content with other volunteers. She prohibited “hate speech or bullying” and “instructed group members not to post anything threatening, hateful, or that promoted violence or illegal conduct.” Facebook only ever flagged five posts that supposedly violated community guidelines, but in warnings, the company reassured Rosado that “groups aren’t penalized when members or visitors break the rules without admin approval.” Rosado had no reason to suspect that her group was in danger of removal. When Facebook disabled her group, it told Rosado the group violated community standards “multiple times.” But her complaint noted that, confusingly, “Facebook policies don’t provide for disabling groups if a few members post ostensibly prohibited content; they call for removing groups when the group moderator repeatedly either creates prohibited content or affirmatively ‘approves’ such content.” Facebook’s decision came after a right-wing influencer, Laura Loomer, tagged Noem and Bondi in a social media post alleging that the group was “getting people killed.” Within two days, Bondi bragged that she had gotten the group disabled while claiming that it “was being used to dox and target [ICE] agents in Chicago.” McDonnell told Ars it seems clear that Bondi selectively uses the term “doxing” when people post images from ICE arrests. He pointed to “ICE’s own social media accounts,” which share favorable opinions of ICE alongside videos and photos of ICE arrests that Bondi doesn’t consider doxing. “Rosado’s creation of Facebook groups to send and receive information about where and how ICE carries out its duties in public, to share photographs and videos of ICE carrying out its duties in public, and to exchange opinions about and criticism of ICE’s tactics in carrying out its duties, is speech protected by the First Amendment,” FIRE argued. The same goes for speech managed by Mark Hodges, a US citizen who resides in Indiana. He created an app called Eyes Up to serve as an archive of ICE videos. Apple removed Eyes Up from the App Store around the same time that it removed ICEBlock. “It is just videos of what government employees did in public carrying out their duties,” McDonnell said. “It’s nothing even close to threatening or doxing or any of these other theories that the government has used to justify suppressing speech.” Bondi bragged that she had gotten ICEBlock banned, and FIRE’s complaint confirmed that Hodges’ company received the same notification that ICEBlock’s developer got after Bondi’s victory lap. The notice said that Apple received “information” from “law enforcement” claiming that the apps had violated Apple guidelines against “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content.” Apple did not reach the same conclusion when it independently reviewed Eyes Up prior to government meddling, FIRE’s complaint said. Notably, the app remains available in Google Play, and Rosado now manages a new Facebook group with similar content but somewhat tighter restrictions on who can join. Neither activity has required urgent intervention from either tech giants or the government. McDonnell told Ars that it’s harmful for DHS to water down the meaning of doxing when pushing platforms to remove content critical of ICE. “When most of us hear the word ‘doxing,’ we think of something that’s threatening, posting private information along with home addresses or places of work,” McDonnell said. “And it seems like the government is expanding that definition to encompass just sharing, even if there’s no threats, nothing violent. Just sharing information about what our government is doing.” Expanding the definition and then using that term to justify suppressing speech is concerning, he said, especially since the First Amendment includes no exception for “doxing,” even if DHS ever were to provide evidence of it. To suppress speech, officials must show that groups are inciting violence or making true threats. FIRE has alleged that the government has not met “the extraordinary justifications required for a prior restraint” on speech and is instead using vague doxing threats to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint. They’re seeking a permanent injunction barring officials from coercing tech companies into censoring ICE posts. If plaintiffs win, the censorship threats could subside, and tech companies may feel safe reinstating apps and Facebook groups, advocates told Ars. That could potentially revive archives documenting thousands of ICE incidents and reconnect webs of ICE watchers who lost access to valued feeds. Until courts possibly end threats of censorship, the most cautious community members are moving local ICE-watch efforts to group chats and listservs that are harder for the government to disrupt, Trujillo told Ars.

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson has accused Apple of violating US law by suppressing conservative-leaning news outlets on Apple News. Ferguson pointed to research by a pro-Trump group that accused Apple News of suppressing articles by Fox News, the New York Post, Daily Mail, Breitbart, and The Gateway Pundit. The FTC chair claims that Apple News might be violating promises made to consumers in its terms of service, but his letter doesn’t cite any specific provisions from the Apple terms that might have been violated. “Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications,” Ferguson wrote in the letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook yesterday. He said the “reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers, as well as the reasonable consumer expectations of the tens of millions of Americans who use Apple News.” Craig Aaron, president and co-CEO of media advocacy group Free Press, told Ars that Ferguson’s “letter would be laughable if it weren’t so dangerous. This is what government censorship looks like. Ferguson’s claims of course aren’t based on any facts or evidence, just innuendo from discredited partisan operatives who think The Wall Street Journal is too woke. Just imagine if another administration had told Drudge or Fox News what stories they should feature on their apps or home pages.” Ferguson told Cook, “As an American citizen, I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons. Such efforts, whether taken to appease overzealous activists, at the behest of foreign governments, or simply to advance the political views of Silicon Valley elites, stifle the free exchange of ideas, manipulate the public discourse, and are inconsistent with American values.” We contacted Apple about Ferguson’s letter and will update this article if it provides a response. Aaron said that “Apple must respond and condemn this government intrusion. Capitulating to or appeasing government censors will never work. If these companies are as committed to free expression as they claim to be, it’s time to take a stand.” “FTC is not the speech police” Ferguson’s letter stated that the “FTC is not the speech police; we do not have authority to require Apple or any other firm to take affirmative positions on any political issue, nor to curate news offerings consistent with one ideology or another.” But he pointed out that the FTC has power to ensure that companies do not violate promises made to consumers. “Congress has mandated that we protect consumers from material misrepresentations and omissions, including when the product or service offered to consumers is a speech-related product,” he wrote. Ferguson suggested that Apple News promoting liberal publications might violate the service’s terms of use, but the Apple News terms themselves mostly impose obligations on users and include nothing about avoiding partisan bias in news selection. The terms say Apple News content is presented “as-is,” and that the only recourse for someone who doesn’t like the service is to stop using it. Whether Ferguson or anyone at the FTC carefully reviewed the Apple News terms is not clear from the letter; Ferguson says that Apple must conduct such a review. Ferguson seems to acknowledge that there would be no legal violation if Apple hasn’t made any promises to consumers about the political leanings of news sources highlighted by Apple news. Ferguson wrote: As the Chairman of the FTC, I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act. Any act or practice by Apple News to suppress or promote news articles based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication, if inconsistent with Apple’s terms of service or the reasonable expectations of consumers, may violate the FTC Act. I encourage you to conduct a comprehensive review of Apple’s terms of service and ensure that Apple News’ curation of articles is consistent with those terms and representations made to consumers and, if it is not, to take corrective action swiftly. Ferguson’s letter links to the Apple News terms . He notes that they “address a wide range of topics” related to “the content of the site, a consumer’s use of the site, prohibited conduct, privacy and data security, and dispute resolution.” But he didn’t go into any more detail. Apple terms: “Your sole remedy…. is to stop using the site” What do the Apple News terms say? Along with prohibiting scraping, hacking, and other conduct, the terms make it clear that users shouldn’t expect to see any particular types of content on the site or app. “Apple does not promise that the site or any content, service or feature of the site will be error-free or uninterrupted, or that any defects will be corrected, or that your use of the site will provide specific results,” the terms say. “The site and its content are delivered on an ‘as-is’ and ‘as-available’ basis… your sole remedy against Apple for dissatisfaction with the site or any content is to stop using the site or any such content. This limitation of relief is a part of the bargain between the parties.” The terms say that Apple News may display third-party materials and links to third-party websites, and that users must “acknowledge and agree that Apple is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Apple, its officers, affiliates, and subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any Third Party Materials or Linked Sites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you.” Despite Apple’s terms making no promises about the quality of third-party content in Apple News, both Ferguson and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr seem to think the FTC allegations against Apple are convincing. “Today I sent a letter to Tim Cook expressing my concerns about allegations that Apple News has, unbeknownst to its users, systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed content from conservative publications,” Ferguson wrote in an X post yesterday. Carr, who has repeatedly amplified Trump’s complaints about media and threatened to revoke broadcast station licenses, wrote yesterday that “FTC Chairman Ferguson is exactly right. 🎯 Apple has no right to suppress conservative viewpoints in violation of the FTC Act.” FTC cites bias claim from pro-Trump group While Ferguson’s letter lacks a specific claim that Apple violated its own terms of service, there’s still Ferguson’s vague warning that bias in news aggregation may violate the FTC Act if it “is contrary to consumers’ reasonable expectations such that failure to disclose the ideological favoritism is a material omission.” He also wrote that tech companies “suppress[ing] or promot[ing] news articles in their news aggregators or feeds based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication may violate the FTC Act… when those practices cause substantial injury that is neither reasonably avoidable nor outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.” Ferguson said that “multiple studies have found that in recent months Apple News has chosen not to feature a single article from an American conservative-leaning news source, while simultaneously promoting hundreds of articles from liberal publications.” Both studies referred to in the letter come from the Media Research Center founded by L. Brent Bozell III, who is now US ambassador to South Africa following a nomination by President Trump. The Media Research Center argues that “President Donald Trump and the United States appear to stand alone in the fight to preserve free expression.” Under Trump, the group says, “much is being done to correct course and loosen the Biden-era censorship cartel’s stranglehold on American liberty.” The Media Research Center says its mission “is to document and combat the falsehoods and censorship of the news media, entertainment media and Big Tech in order to defend and preserve America’s founding principles and Judeo-Christian values.” The group’s most recent report on Apple News faults the service for highlighting articles by “leftist outlets,” which it identifies as The Washington Post, Associated Press, NBC News, The Guardian, The New York Times, Apple itself, NPR, Politico, USA Today, and Bloomberg News. Group says Apple News needs more Breitbart The group said its study focused on the top 20 articles in the Apple News morning edition on each day of January. It said that all of the 620 highlighted articles were from “left-leaning and other outlets.” The Media Research Center counted The Wall Street Journal as a “center outlet,” lumping it into the same broad category it applied to outlets it describes as leftist. “Rather than promoting news stories from notable right-leaning media sources such as Fox News, the New York Post, Daily Mail, Breitbart or The Gateway Pundit, Apple News has relentlessly pushed articles from elitist media outlets that amplify the left’s narrative, like: The Washington Post, The Associated Press and NBC News as well as center outlets like The Wall Street Journal and Reuters,” the group said. The Gateway Pundit is known for publishing election-related misinformation and has been beset by defamation lawsuits . Ferguson’s FTC has also investigated NewsGuard, a company that rates news sources on reliability. NewsGuard sued the FTC last week in an attempt to stop the probe, which it said “was instigated in large part by Newsmax.” NewsGuard said in its lawsuit that the court should also invalidate a merger condition imposed on the Omnicom/Interpublic Group deal that effectively “prohibits Omnicom and its ad agencies and affiliates from using NewsGuard’s services.” “The FTC has pursued its campaign because Chairman Ferguson does not like NewsGuard’s news ratings, which he views as biased against conservative publications,” the NewsGuard lawsuit said. “That is wrong—NewsGuard’s ratings and journalism about news sources are non-partisan and based on fully disclosed journalistic criteria. But the FTC’s actions are plainly unconstitutional even if that were not the case. The First Amendment does not allow the government to pick and choose speech based on what it likes or dislikes.” Jon Brodkin Senior IT Reporter Jon Brodkin Senior IT Reporter 196 Comments",

      "content": "Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images Companies in the Bay Area host popular game nights that feature humanoid robots. Robots are made by Unitree and other Chinese companies, which dominate the global market. Despite enthusiastic fans and ambitious plans, a researcher says it is just “robot theater.” The Super Bowl wasn’t the only sporting event that drew excited fans to the Bay Area last weekend. An event at a much smaller venue in San Francisco was hailed as the future of combat sports: virtual reality-controlled humanoid robots boxing in a cage. The match was organized by Rek, a San Francisco-based company, and drew hundreds of spectators who had paid about $60–$80 for a ticket to watch modified G1 robots go at each other. Made by Unitree , the dominant Chinese robot maker, they weighed in at around 80 pounds and stood 4.5 feet tall, with human-like hands and dozens of joint motors for flexibility. The match had all the bells and whistles of a regular boxing bout: pulsing music, cameras capturing all the angles, hyped-up introductions, a human referee, and even two commentators. The evening featured two bouts made up of five rounds, each lasting 60 seconds. The robots pranced around the cage, throwing jabs and punches, drawing ohs and ahs from the crowd. They fell sometimes, and needed human intervention to get them back on their feet. Rek plans to put on more matches, and develop a league of robot boxers, including full-height robots that weigh about 200 pounds and are nearly 6 feet tall, founder Cix Liv told Rest of World . “Right now we are mainly focused on the U.S. But we will consider international matches after our next big event in a few months,” he said, without giving details. The Rek match — the second in San Francisco — came just days before the world’s first humanoid robot “combat league” launched in China. Called the “ultimate robot knock-out legend,” the competition combines “competitive spectacle with technological challenges,” according to a statement from Engine AI, a robot maker in Shenzhen. The champion team stands to win a prize worth about $1.4 million. Pictures from the launch showed Engine AI’s full-height T800 robots that can kick, jump, and punch. In China, humanoid boxing matches, races, and football games have become common in recent years, with robot makers showcasing the skills of their latest products at the annual spring gala to hundreds of millions of television viewers. In San Francisco, Rek isn’t the only company capitalizing on the artificial intelligence boom and eager techies with cash to burn. Ultimate Fighting Bots — claiming to be the world’s first robot combat league with human pilots — also hosts game nights with Chinese robots. David Hatch, a San Francisco resident who works in tech design and is a science-fiction and design nerd, told Rest of World he enjoyed the Rek match. “I do see more people really getting into seeing robots fight — you can see how the crowd here got excited, and there were some rousing moments,” he said. “You can do a lot of things with robots — there can be a lot of customization, it can be a lot more participatory with VR glasses.” &nbsp; While the Rek match and the URKL showcase robots far more advanced than those in BattleBots , the 1990s American television show that featured fighting robots with weapons, much of it still remains “robot theater,” said Ken Goldberg, a professor of engineering and robotics researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. “We are in the middle of the humanoid craze today; they look human-like and do some things, but they’re not very sophisticated,” he said at a recent briefing in San Francisco. “Many of them have humans controlling them. Which is why I always tell people who are impressed with robot videos: Beware of what you see in the videos, it isn’t quite real.” China dominates the humanoid robot industry , with nearly 90% of those sold last year made by Chinese companies including Unitree, AgiBot, and Engine AI. The firms use hundreds of workers to generate the training data needed for the robots. A basic G1 is priced upward of $13,000, while a T800 costs more than $40,000. Most are used in research, retail, and for industrial purposes. A small number will end up in boxing cages in San Francisco. At the Rek match, the crowd cheered as a 13-year-old VR pilot named Dash beat his older competitor. Hatch stood and clapped: “That was awesome!”&nbsp; Hatch was also pleased that no one got hurt. “You can repair the damage more easily with robots,&#8221; he said.",

      "content": "Listen to this article | 8 minsinfoPeople wearing traditional Thai dress gather next to a campaign poster of the Bhumjaithai Party in Bangkok, Thailand, on February 7, 2026 [Maxim Shemetov/Reuters]By Vijitra Duangdee14 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkBangkok – Thailand’s swing to more conservative politics in last weekend’s election reveals as much about the dynamics of local power brokers as it does the missteps of the main progressive party, which failed to get its message to stick outside of urban centres. Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, comfortably won Sunday’s election, according to an unofficial count by the Election Commission of Thailand (ECT), securing more than 190 of the 500 seats in Thailand’s parliament. While the ECT has 60 days to verify the results, Anutin is wasting no time. On Tuesday, his attention had already turned to forming a coalition government with himself as prime minister, as his election rivals were left to pick through the ruins of their failed campaigns. The youth-facing reformers in the People’s Party had been widely expected to secure the largest number of seats and the biggest share of the vote. But they won just 118 seats, according to the ECT’s website, dozens fewer than the party secured in the 2023 election. The drop in support would seem to suggest that the public has turned away from the People’s Party’s call for structural reform in Thailand’s economy and politics. Votes appear to have shifted to Anutin’s camp, an arch-nationalist who represents the interests of the country’s political and economic elite. Though allegations of vote-buying and other polling irregularities in close constituency contests were growing, even the People’s Party leader, Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut, said it would not have been large enough to change the overall result. Instead, a tearful Nattaphong apologised in a television interview to the party’s faithful and his members of parliament who lost their seats. “I’m sad how the results turned out … but despite these tears, I’m committed to carrying on working for the people,” the 38-year-old said. Analysts and political insiders told Al Jazeera that the People’s Party’s loss of voters – apart from urban areas in and around the capital, Bangkok, and the northern city of Chiang Mai – pointed to the deeper realities of Thai politics that continue to be insurmountable for reformists. First among those obstacles is political patronage, experts say, where political support is based upon the promise of future favours. Powerful political dynasties, called “Baan Yai” (Big Houses) in the Thai language, are entrenched across the country and particularly in Chonburi, Buriram and Sisaket provinces. The “Baan Yai” joined forces under Anutin’s Bhumjaithai Party umbrella and brought along their followers to block out the People’s Party on election day. “It’s been like this for a really long time,” said an aide to one of the most prominent of the political dynasties. “In Bangkok, they think of their MPs as lawmakers, but we see them as village heads – someone who goes out and bats for you,” said the aide, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. “This is a person you see every day. This is the person who fixes your problems,” the aide added. Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a constitutional law scholar at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the People’s Party may have made a strategic mistake by neglecting “to combat the entrenched influence of Baan Yai” over local voters. “Because resources are so scarce, rural populations do not view an MP as a representative in the civic sense … instead, they see them as a ‘clan leader’,” Khemthong explained. “They remain tethered to this patronage system because it is effectively the only safety net they have,” he said. Thailand’s last election in 2023 delivered a shock warning to some of those dynasties – in Chiang Mai and Chonburi – as younger voters could not be counted on to respect the influence of the Baan Yai at the polls. That year, a so-called “orange wave” got behind the strong pro-democracy and reform message of the Move Forward Party – the People’s Party predecessor – after nine years of military rule by former army chief Prayut Chan-ocha. Move Forward won that election, but it was promptly dissolved as a political party by the courts over its intention to reform the country’s draconian royal defamation laws, which protect Thailand’s powerful monarchy from criticism. Move Forward rose from the ashes and came back as the People’s Party. But with its front-line leaders banned from politics, the movement struggled to reorganise across Thailand, another reason given for the party’s shortfall at the polls last weekend. Barely 24 hours after polling stations closed, Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) forwarded a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to ban 44 of the People’s Party Members of Parliament – including Natthaphong – from politics. The Supreme Court’s decision could result in a lifetime ban for the progressive MPs – the latest legal blows to its momentum. Nationalism also played a big part in Anutin’s win, particularly in the wake of the recent border war with neighbouring Cambodia. Bhumjaithai cast itself as the party that got behind the military during the conflict and cast its political rivals as less able to protect the country. Now, as election analysts assess the results, it appears that the return of the Baan Yai was the most crucial to Anutin’s decisive win, as old political power brokers consolidated under Bhumjaithai’s conservative credentials and refrained from splitting the vote share, which would have been advantageous to the progressive bloc. “Voter turnout is at a historic low in the last 30 years, only 65 percent, according to the Election Commission,” said Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a Thai politics expert and an academic at Thammasat University in Bangkok. “When voter turnout is low, the ‘organised votes’ [mobilised supporters] and the influence of the ‘Baan Yais’ become the deciding factors,” he said. Preliminary results show that Bhumjaithai made significant gains from central Thailand to the northeast, as well as the southernmost border area with Malaysia – many seats being won due to support from political families who expressed their support publicly for Anutin before the vote. Beyond the drop in support for reformers and MPs losing their seats, the vote has left many Gen Z supporters at a loss as to why people did not choose to change Thailand for the better. They wonder why their countrymen appear to have thrown their support behind conservatism rather than change, especially when the poor are falling further behind the rich in Thailand’s slowing economy. For People’s Party voter Arsikin Singthong, 22, who lives in Thailand’s southern Muslim-majority border province of Pattani, the reason can be found in money, politics and rural poverty. “These Baan Yai politicians buy the poverty of rural people. This is the game,” Arsikin told Al Jazeera. “But they can’t buy the urban population any more because we have already woken up,” she said. The return of the political dynasties as power brokers reflects the systemic poverty still found in many parts of rural Thailand, analysts say. The northeast, north and south lean towards political dynasties and populist promises in nearly all Thai elections, they say. “The country is fundamentally split by resource allocation,” said Chulalongkorn University’s Khemthong. “A younger generation has managed to break free from these patronage networks,” Khemthong said, referring to urban voters who form the People’s Party support base in Bangkok and elsewhere. “They have the luxury of dissent because they have exited the system that still binds those left behind,” he added.",

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story be a banner year for the real estate app Zillow. “We describe the home market as bouncing along the bottom,” CEO Jeremy Wacksman said in our conversation this week. Last year was dismal for the real estate market, and he expects things to improve only marginally in 2026. (If January’s historic drop in home sales is indicative, that even is overoptimistic.) “The way to think about it is that there were 4.1 million existing homes sold last year—a normal market is 5.5 to 6 million,” Wacksman says. He hastens to add that Zillow itself is doing better than the real estate industry overall. Still, its valuation is a quarter of its high-water mark in 2021. A few hours after we spoke, Wacksman announced that Zillow’s earnings had increased last quarter. Nonetheless, Zillow’s stock price fell nearly 5 percent the next day. Wacksman does see a bright spot—AI. Like every other company in the world, generative AI presents both an opportunity and a risk to Zillow’s business. Wacksman much prefers to dwell on the upside. “We think AI is actually an ingredient rather than a threat,” he said on the earnings call. “In the last couple years, the LLM revolution has really opened all of our eyes to what&#x27;s possible,” he tells me. Zillow is integrating AI into every aspect of its business, from the way it showcases houses to having agents automate its workflow. Wacksman marvels that with Gen AI, you can search for “homes near my kid’s new school, with a fenced-in yard, under $3,000 a month.” On the other hand, his customers might wind up making those same queries on chatbots operated by OpenAI and Google, and Wacksman must figure out how to make their next step a jump to Zillow. In its 20-year history—Zillow celebrated the anniversary this week—the company has always used AI. Wacksman, who joined in 2009 and became CEO in 2024, notes that machine learning is the engine behind those “Zestimates” that gauge a home’s worth at any given moment. Zestimates became a viral sensation that helped make the app irresistible, and sites like Zillow Gone Wild —which is also a TV show on the HGTV network—have built a business around highlighting the most intriguing or bizarre listings. More recently, Zillow has spent billions aggressively pursuing new technology. One ongoing effort is upleveling the presentation of homes for sale. A feature called SkyTour uses an AI technology called Gaussian Splatting to turn drone footage into a 3D rendering of the property. (I love typing the words “Gassian Splatting” and can’t believe an indie band hasn’t adopted it yet.) AI also powers a feature inside Zillow’s Showcase component called Virtual Staging , which supplies homes with furniture that doesn’t really exist. There is risky ground here: Once you abandon the authenticity of an actual photo, the question arises whether you’re actually seeing a trustworthy representation of the property. “It’s important that both buyer and seller understand the line between Virtual Staging and the reality of a photo,” says Wacksman. “A virtually staged image has to be clearly watermarked and disclosed.” He says he’s confident that licensed professionals will abide by rules, but as AI becomes dominant, “we have to evolve those rules,” he says. Right now, Zillow estimates that only a single-digit percentage of its users take advantage of these exotic display features. Particularly disappointing is a foray called Zillow Immerse, which runs on the Apple Vision Pro. Upon rollout in February 2024, Zillow called it “ the future of home tours .” Note that it doesn&#x27;t claim to be the near-future. “That platform hasn&#x27;t yet come to broad consumer prominence,” says Wacksman of Apple’s underperforming innovation. “I do think that VR and AR are going to come.” Zillow is on more solid ground using AI to make its own workforce more productive. “It’s helping us do our job better,” says Wacksman, who adds that programmers are churning out more code, customer support tasks have been automated, and design teams have shortened timelines for implementing new products. As a result, he says, Zillow has been able to keep its headcount “relatively flat.” (Zillow did cut some jobs recently, but Wacksman says that involved “a handful of folks that were not meeting a performance bar.”) —regarding how private listings are handled.) It’s hard enough for Zillow to stay ahead of rivals. But as users increasingly use chatbots as a front end to all sorts of information, it has to worry about customers bypassing its app and going straight to the big LLMs. Zillow moved to stay ahead of this potential shift by becoming one the first third-party platforms to integrate with OpenAI’s platform. But when I used the chatbot to view homes for sale in one Western Massachusetts town, it took a few tries before it surfaced a link to activate the Zillow app. Without that activation, the links to homes for sale were distributed, seemingly randomly, between Zillow and competitors Homes.com, Realtor.com , and so forth. OpenAI is circumspect about what it will do with its newfound power: “It’s still early, and we continue to learn,” said spokesperson Niko Felix about how the company handles its apps. Which isn’t quite the same as saying “our developers can be 100 percent sure that we will never compete with them.” Even scarier for Zillow is a recent move by the biggest hyperscaler of all—Google. Working with a real-estate analytics company called HouseCanary, the search and AI giant has been experimenting in several cities with putting home listings alongside Google real estate agent ads in search . Click on the link and Google shows its own Zillow-style staging, with accompanying critical information like square footage and photo galleries—as well as a link to schedule a viewing with a real estate agent advertising on Google. A Google spokesperson says it&#x27;s an expansion of its existing real estate agent ads, supplemented with new information to make them more helpful. If the test works out, it’s easy to imagine that Google one day might bring the same data to AI products like Gemini. (Google does say that the experiment did not involve Gemini, and currently no ads run on the AI model.) Predictably, the Google experiment led to yet another dip in Zillow’s stock price. It also generated speculation that Google might buy Zillow . Wacksman seems oddly sanguine about the nearly $4 trillion behemoth eyeing his business, dismissing Google’s experiment as just another way for the company to get more eyeballs and thus increase ad revenue. “Sure, they might grab some more marginal ad dollars,” he says. “But when buyers and sellers want to find a real estate site to use for the transaction, they find us, and that&#x27;s why so much of our traffic comes direct to us. Once you want to consume a virtual tour listing, once you want to get preapproved, once you want to start messaging with real estate agents, you really need a really deep, integrated experience.” This is an edition of Steven Levy’s Backchannel newsletter .

      "content": "Share Save Share Save Getty Images James Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancer Actor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson&#x27;s Creek, he walked some of the industry&#x27;s hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a &quot;new superstar&quot;. But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious financial situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills. Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago. The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far. Getty Images James Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional still In the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he&#x27;d saved for decades from the roles that defined his career - a plaid buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson&#x27;s Creek, a necklace he gifted to Katie Holmes&#x27; character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues. &quot;I&#x27;ve been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it&#x27;s clear that the time is now,&quot; Van Der Beek told People Magazine last November. On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he&#x27;d seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid &quot;almost nothing&quot; for Dawson&#x27;s Creek and his contract didn&#x27;t include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments. &quot;There was no residual money,&quot; Van Der Beek told Today in 2012. &quot;I was 20. It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.&quot; He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it&#x27;s unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors&#x27; union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through SAG-AFTRA only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union. Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile American actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer. Getty Images Van Der Beek and his Dawson&#x27;s Creek co-stars pictured in 1997 Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel&#x27;s Ant Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals have become a problem for actors across the board. &quot;Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,&quot; he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union SAG-AFTRA. &quot;I work when I&#x27;m hired and I survive when I&#x27;m not.&quot; Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t work,&quot; he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again. Davis said that just 10 years ago, the union&#x27;s minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors. Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with SAG-AFTRA. But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added. In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a &quot;full-time job&quot; dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance. His death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem. The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data. The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek&#x27;s widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from 4 to 15. His wife shared the page, which noted the &quot;significant financial strain&quot; the family had seen as they &quot;did everything possible to support James and provide for his care&quot;. &quot;In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James&#x27;s medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,&quot; the page reads. &quot;They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.&quot; Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000. This is because in the US private health-care system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people. &quot;People simply can&#x27;t afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,&quot; she said. &quot;When even someone with James Van Der Beek&#x27;s resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it&#x27;s clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.&quot; Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage. &quot;It&#x27;s in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,&quot; he said. &quot;The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.&quot; More weekend picks No big names.

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app. Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store. Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card. “If you payoff [ sic ] a device payment agreement balance online or in the My Verizon App, or if a Verizon Gift Card is used to purchase a smartphone or pay off a remaining balance, the unlocking process will be delayed by 35 days,” the current version of the policy says. “This window allows for the verification of the gift card’s funds to ensure they were not obtained through fraudulent or illegal means.” The paragraph above only explains why the waiting period is necessary for gift-card payments despite applying the 35-day wait to online and app payments as well. In a previous version of the policy that was implemented on January 27 and still in place as of February 9 , the 35-day waiting period applied only when a Verizon gift card is used to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance. The 35-day waiting period provision was changed to include online and app payments by February 11. We were made aware of the most recent change thanks to a tip from Ars forum member User_E. Customers must go to Verizon corporate store Despite the significant update that happened this week, Verizon still lists the effective date of the device unlocking policy as January 27. It thus appears that Verizon is applying the 35-day wait after online and app payments retroactively, without disclosing that the policy changed after January 27. The 35-day waiting period seems to apply regardless of how long the phone has been in use. For example, if you were 18 months into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and decided to pay the remaining balance early and switch carriers, you’d still have to wait 35 days for an unlock in most scenarios. A Verizon spokesperson told Ars today that customers meeting the requirements for a quick unlock will “typically” receive it within 24 hours. But “if you pay online, through the app, or use a ‘non-secure’ method (like a Verizon Gift Card, paper check, or magnetic stripe swipe), there is a 35-day security delay before the unlock triggers to prevent fraud,” the spokesperson said. Verizon did not explain why the device unlocking policy still has an effective date of January 27 despite the change made this week. It is possible to pay off an installment plan early by going to a Verizon store. But there are limits on this, too. Another Verizon FAQ says the company will unlock a phone “when you use a secure payment type at a Verizon store. Payments made through your account online, in the My Verizon app, a Verizon Authorized Retailer, or by phone delay the unlock by 35 days.” It’s not clear when this FAQ was last updated. The Verizon Authorized Retailer limitation means that to get a quick unlock, you have to go to a Verizon corporate store rather than a Verizon Authorized Retailer that isn’t owned by Verizon. Verizon corporate stores accounted for only about 20 percent of Verizon stores, according to Wave7 research cited in a 2021 Fierce Network article . As for the “secure payment type” requirement, you can satisfy that by paying with cash, a credit card with an EMV chip, or contactless payment method like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. The requirements may be different for consumer and business customers. A Verizon business FAQ says paying off a device using a bill credit also triggers a 35-day wait, but that caveat isn’t mentioned in the Verizon consumer FAQ. Even if you happen to live near a Verizon corporate store, it’s still less convenient than paying online or in an app. A customer can alternatively buy a phone from Verizon at full price at the beginning to get it unlocked right away, but not everyone will want to or be able to do that. “Devices purchased directly from Verizon are locked to our network. Devices will be unlocked automatically when purchased at full retail price or if the device financing agreement balance is paid in full,” the unlocking policy for postpaid devices says, right before disclosing the 35-day waiting period that applies in various scenarios. There shouldn’t be a wait for unlocking if a customer pays off a device plan on schedule via automatic payments. Verizon confirmed to Ars that “if a Verizon customer has automatic monthly payments set up on a device payment plan, the device is automatically unlocked after the final scheduled payment.” Prepaid phones locked for a year Verizon’s latest unlocking policy for prepaid devices is simpler than its postpaid policy but still locks customers to the Verizon network for a year. “Devices purchased from us will remain locked to the network until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service,” the prepaid device unlocking policy says. “After 365 days of paid and active service, we will automatically remove the lock unless the device is deemed stolen or purchased fraudulently.” Despite using the phrase “automatically remove the lock” in reference to prepaid devices in its device unlocking policy, Verizon seems to contradict this on an FAQ page by saying that prepaid customers must request an unlock after 365 days. Unlocks are made “upon request” if a customer meets the criteria, the page says. Until recently, the US government required Verizon to unlock handsets automatically after 60 days, via rules imposed on 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions imposed on Verizon’s purchase of TracFone . The Federal Communications Commission eliminated the 60-day unlocking requirement on January 12 for all phones activated on Verizon’s network after the FCC decision. Verizon says it is still honoring 60-day unlocks for phones bought from its flagship brand before January 27. The AT&amp;T policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says that postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&amp;T has a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones. A week after the FCC ruling, Verizon started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division. Customers of TracFone and other “Verizon Value” brands have to request unlocks after the year is over as Verizon doesn’t promise to unlock phones automatically for those subsidiary brands. “Most people pay their bills online” The policy for Verizon’s flagship brand promises automatic unlocks, albeit with the new restrictions and waits described earlier in this article. John Bergmayer, legal director of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Ars today that he doesn’t understand why Verizon isn’t offering immediate unlocks to people who pay their bills online. “Gift cards, sure, are a pretty high-fraud area. But most people pay their bills online with normal credit cards. It’s hard to see what is likely the most common way people pay Verizon as being somehow high-risk,” he said. Verizon also shouldn’t apply the change retroactively, he said. “People should be able to benefit from the policy that was in place on the day they bought the phone,” Bergmayer told Ars. Public Knowledge and other consumer advocacy groups urged the FCC last year to reject Verizon’s petition to end the 60-day unlocking requirement, but the FCC sided with Verizon. Although the federal rules have changed, Verizon can be forced to uphold its previous terms in cases where the company tries to change them retroactively. In December, we wrote about a man who sued Verizon and won after the firm retroactively tried to enforce a new policy and refused to unlock a phone he purchased before the policy change. In that case, Verizon decided it would only unlock phones after “60 days of paid active service” even though FCC rules at the time required unlocks 60 days after activation regardless of whether paid service was maintained.

      "content": "Share Save Share Save LightRocket/Getty Images For as long as many residents of Nairobi can remember, the Kenyan capital has been awash with red every 14 February. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, people are dressed in red, the colour of love and romance, or are carrying red roses. Traders are quick to cash in, selling fresh blooms from local farms, as Kenya is one of the world&#x27;s top producers of cut flowers. Recently though, instead of the soft red petals, some people have been opting for the brown, blue or purple of crisp banknotes, folded, rolled or fastened together into floral-like bouquets. The trend has spread to other African countries and has become so pervasive that it has drawn the concern of central banks in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Botswana and Namibia. They have all issued public warnings against damaging or defacing banknotes when making these bouquets of cash. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) says that in many instances, banknotes are &quot;glued, taped, stapled, pinned or otherwise affixed&quot;. Damaged notes can then be rejected by automated teller machines (ATMs) and cash‑sorting equipment, meaning they have to be withdrawn from circulation, at a cost to the taxpayer. In its notice, the CBK said it was not opposed to the use of cash gifts - only to practices that damaged notes - an offence that could lead to creators of money bouquets being jailed for up to seven years. Cash bouquets have been popularised by celebrities and online influencers, who often share videos of themselves presenting such gifts. The celebrations are not limited to Valentine&#x27;s Day - they extend to birthdays and other special occasions, meaning money bouquets are in demand throughout the year. The bouquets come in various designs, with creators arranging the banknotes to suit the taste and budget of each customer. The wads of cash used in such bouquets vary widely - they can amount to as little as 1,000 shillings ($8; £6) or as much as a million shillings, says Angela Muthoni, a florist at the Gift and Flowers shop in central Nairobi. While many are created in floral designs, or a mix of flowers and money with elegant wrappings, they can also be part of cake designs or be given in gift boxes. Muthoni says money bouquets have become popular in the last two years. In the run-up to Valentine&#x27;s Day, she has been receiving orders of between 15 and 20 bouquets every day, despite the CBK&#x27;s warning. &quot;Everyone loves money,&quot; she tells the BBC, adding that gifting people cash takes away the stress of choosing a present. Some Kenyans, however, argue that it just shows that people are becoming more materialistic, seeking to buy love with money, rather than romance. &quot;It&#x27;s some form of peer pressure,&quot; 24-year-old Haskell Austin tells the BBC. He prefers giving flowers, describing the idea of gifting money as &quot;materialistic&quot;. But if cash must be given, he prefers a straightforward transfer instead of folding or decorating it into bouquets. AFP This Ugandan bouquet would be OK as the banknotes have not been damaged A woman who identifies herself only as Lynn is disappointed by the timing of the CBK&#x27;s caution against making cash bouquets, coming just ahead of Valentine&#x27;s Day, as she was looking forward to receiving one. &quot;People are still excited about the trend,&quot; she tells the BBC at Koinange Street, a popular spot for buying flowers in Nairobi. &quot;I would prefer cash,&quot; Nicole Rono tells the BBC. &quot;Who doesn&#x27;t love money? Flowers are OK, yes, but now with what the CBK has said, you can still give cash without damaging it,&quot; she says. For university student Benjamin Nambwaya, the fact that women are usually the recipients is based on social expectations. He tells the BBC that the culture of giving money bouquets is a &quot;bad thing&quot; and can end up &quot;destroying relationships&quot;, especially when it creates an expectation even when one cannot afford to give money. He would prefer to give flowers. &quot;I think flowers are cool, because this is a small celebration or something just to show how how much you really adore this person,&quot; he says. Economic expert Odhiambo Ramogi says it is all about &quot;our capitalistic approach to life&quot;. &quot;Capitalistic societies are driven by advertising, by marketing and special days like Valentine&#x27;s are a very good opportunity.&quot; For Muthoni, the florist, it comes down to how someone wants to express their love. &quot;Love people the way they want to be loved,&quot; she says, although she concedes that ultimately money is at the heart of it. &quot;You can buy a lot of things with money. You might not know what someone likes, but money is the solution.&quot; Discussions about money bouquets have been widespread on social media since the CBK&#x27;s warning, drawing both praise and derision. It has sparked some humour as well, such as memes of bouquets made from rolled chapati bread . LightRocket via Getty Images Banknotes are folded or rolled to make the bouquets Speaking about the trend on TikTok, Kenyan Scott Ian Obaro said it may also have encouraged a culture of &quot;showing off&quot;. Ramogi argues that the idea of giving flowers is largely a foreign concept in Africa, which he says helps explain why the culture of gifting money is more readily embraced. &quot;The African hardly gave flowers,&quot; he says, adding that the practice is a Western tradition and that many Kenyans would prefer money &quot;to take care of a need&quot; rather than a flower given purely for sentimental reasons. &quot;But now it&#x27;s combined with the fact that we are more materialistic. The natural flower has been replaced with the currency flower,&quot; he says. The intervention by Kenya&#x27;s regulator, along with those in other countries, may slow the culture of giving money bouquets. Muthoni fears the move could lead to a loss of income for people who have built livelihoods around the bouquets, though she believes there is room for innovation. She says she has designed bouquets with transparent pockets that can hold money without it getting damaged and is considering other ideas such as digital bouquets. Some have switched to using US dollars, which would not be affected by the warning from Kenya&#x27;s central bank. So the money bouquet culture is unlikely to be nipped in the bud any time soon.

The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since notice of the US funding was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial. The Danish researchers are led by Christine Stabell Benn and her husband Peter Aaby of the Bandim Health Project, which is based at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen. Benn and her colleagues have long been controversial for their questionable practices in research into alleged vaccine safety concerns. Kennedy has cited their work in his decision to cut global vaccine funding. The CDC’s funding of Benn’s hepatitis B vaccine trial also came soon after the agency’s advisors—who were handpicked by Kennedy—decided to abandon a long-standing universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose . The move was widely decried by health experts. In the Guinea-Bissau trial, Benn’s team intended to randomize 14,000 newborns to receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at either birth or at six weeks, and then study differences in alleged safety outcomes. Currently, Guinea-Bissau gives the first vaccine dose at the six-week point, but has already decided to transition to recommend a birth dose in 2028. The reason for the delayed implementation is resource constraints. “Exploiting scarcity is not ethical,” the WHO wrote in its statement today. Dangerous trial The United Nations health agency highlighted that the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose is “an effective, and essential public health intervention” that has “been used for over three decades, with more than 115 countries including it in their national schedules. “ “It prevents life‑threatening liver disease by stopping mother‑to‑child transmission at birth,” the WHO wrote, noting that more than 12 percent of adults in Guinea-Bissau have chronic hepatitis B. In a section subtitled “Why withholding the vaccine is unethical,” the WHO lays out all the reasons the trial is dangerous. “From what is publicly described, the [trial] protocol does not appear to ensure even a minimum level of harm reduction and benefit to the study participants (e.g., screening pregnant women and vaccinating newborns exposed to hepatitis B),” the WHO wrote. As a proven lifesaving vaccine, withholding it from some study participants would expose newborns to serious and potentially irreversible harm, including chronic infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, the WHO argues. There is no scientific justification for withholding a proven intervention, and there is no credible evidence of the safety concerns that Benn and her colleagues claim to be looking for in their trial. The WHO also noted that the publicly available information about the trial indicates that it will be a single-blind, no-treatment-controlled design, which “raises a significant likelihood of substantial risk of bias, limiting interpretability of the study results and their policy relevance.” As of now, the trial appears to be suspended. Nature News reported that in a January 22 press conference, health officials in Guinea-Bissau said that a technical and ethical review was pending. “There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau, said. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.” Previously, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that the trial would not go forward. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services provided a statement saying that it was “proceeding as planned.” Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter 48 Comments",

Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring Hayden AI’s scanning technology to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses. “The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars. Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company announced that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide. Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology detected over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane. Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety. “We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].” As part of its setup process, the San Francisco-based startup says that it begins any installation by first mapping a city. Then it teaches the AI the local parking enforcement rules. Typically, those rules say that cars can’t block a bike or bus lane. Traditionally, Hayden AI’s cameras have only been mounted on buses, so enforcement was limited to existing routes. “We tell our system that if you see a vehicle that encroaches on a bike lane, capture a 10-second video and the license plate of that vehicle,” Territo said. “From there, an evidence package goes to the [police] and they will review and verify the elements—that a prosecutable violation exists—and then they will issue a violation under [ state law ]. If there is no violation, the system doesn’t capture any data. The system is only looking for scenarios where a bike lane is blocked and a license plate is evident.” Local bike advocates have applauded this expansion of automated enforcement. “Enforcement cannot be everywhere at once. If we can extend their arm so these things can get done, and keep our community safe, that is a win,” Cynthia Rose, the director of Santa Monica Spoke , told Ars. While warning of the potential misuse of bulk data collection in general, Rose was on board with Hayden AI’s particular plan. “Anywhere where there’s bike infrastructure, where I know of, [blocking the lane] is a problem,” Rose said. “It’s tantamount to parking in handicapped zones. It’s just a flat no.” 59 Comments",

      "content": "AI poses new safety risks to humanity. sarayut Thaneera/Moment via Getty Images OpenAI, the maker of the most popular AI chatbot , used to say it aimed to build artificial intelligence that “safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” according to its 2023 mission statement. But the ChatGPT maker seems to no longer have the same emphasis on doing so “safely.” While reviewing its latest IRS disclosure form, which was released in November 2025 and covers 2024, I noticed OpenAI had removed “safely” from its mission statement , among other changes. That change in wording coincided with its transformation from a nonprofit organization into a business increasingly focused on profits . OpenAI currently faces several lawsuits related to its products’ safety, making this change newsworthy. Many of the plaintiffs suing the AI company allege psychological manipulation, wrongful death and assisted suicide, while others have filed negligence claims. As a scholar of nonprofit accountability and the governance of social enterprises , I see the deletion of the word “safely” from its mission statement as a significant shift that has largely gone unreported – outside highly specialized outlets . And I believe OpenAI’s makeover is a test case for how we, as a society, oversee the work of organizations that have the potential to both provide enormous benefits and do catastrophic harm. Tracing OpenAI’s origins OpenAI, which also makes the Sora video artificial intelligence app, was founded as a nonprofit scientific research lab in 2015. Its original purpose was to benefit society by making its findings public and royalty-free rather than to make money. To raise the money that developing its AI models would require, OpenAI, under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 . Microsoft initially invested US$1 billion in this venture; by 2024 that sum had topped $13 billion. In exchange, Microsoft was promised a portion of future profits, capped at 100 times its initial investment. But the software giant didn’t get a seat on OpenAI’s nonprofit board – meaning it lacked the power to help steer the AI venture it was funding. A subsequent round of funding in late 2024, which raised $6.6 billion from multiple investors, came with a catch: that the funding would become debt unless OpenAI converted to a more traditional for-profit business in which investors could own shares, without any caps on profits, and possibly occupy board seats. Establishing a new structure In October 2025, OpenAI reached an agreement with the attorneys general of California and Delaware to become a more traditional for-profit company . Under the new arrangement, OpenAI was split into two entities: a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit business. The restructured nonprofit, the OpenAI Foundation , owns about one-fourth of the stock in a new for-profit public benefit corporation , the OpenAI Group . Both are headquartered in California but incorporated in Delaware . A public benefit corporation is a business that must consider interests beyond shareholders, such as those of society and the environment, and it must issue an annual benefit report to its shareholders and the public. However, it is up to the board to decide how to weigh those interests and what to report in terms of the benefits and harms caused by the company. The new structure is described in a memorandum of understanding signed in October 2025 by OpenAI and the California attorney general, and endorsed by the Delaware attorney general . Many business media outlets heralded the move, predicting that it would usher in more investment . Two months later, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, finalized a $41 billion investment in OpenAI . Changing its mission statement Most charities must file forms annually with the Internal Revenue Service with details about their missions, activities and financial status to show that they qualify for tax-exempt status. Because the IRS makes the forms public, they have become a way for nonprofits to signal their missions to the world. In its forms for 2022 , and 2023 , OpenAI said its mission was “to build general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” OpenAI’s mission statement as of 2023 included the word ‘safely.’ IRS via Candid That mission statement has changed, as of OpenAI’s 990 form for 2024 – which the company filed with the IRS in late 2025. It became “to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” OpenAI’s mission statement as of 2024 no longer included the word ‘safely.’ IRS via Candid OpenAI had dropped its commitment to safety from its mission statement – along with a commitment to being “unconstrained” by a need to make money for investors. According to Platformer, a tech media outlet, it has also disbanded its “ mission alignment ” team. In my view, these changes explicitly signal that OpenAI is making its profits a higher priority than the safety of its products. To be sure, OpenAI continues to mention safety when it discusses its mission . “We view this mission as the most important challenge of our time,” it states on its website. “It requires simultaneously advancing AI’s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world.” Revising its legal governance structure Nonprofit boards are responsible for key decisions and upholding their organization’s mission . Unlike private companies, board members of tax-exempt charitable nonprofits cannot personally enrich themselves by taking a share of earnings. In cases where a nonprofit owns a for-profit business, as OpenAI did with its previous structure, investors can take a cut of profits – but they typically do not get a seat on the board or have an opportunity to elect board members, because that would be seen as a conflict of interest. The OpenAI Foundation now has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group. In effect, that means that the nonprofit board has given up nearly three-quarters of its control over the company. Software giant Microsoft owns a slightly larger stake – 27% of OpenAI’s stock – due to its $13.8 billion investment in the AI company to date. OpenAI’s employees and its other investors own the rest of the shares. Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks in June 2025, as his company sought to change its structure. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Seeking more investment The main goal of OpenAI’s restructuring, which it called a “ recapitalization ,” was to attract more private investment in the race for AI dominance . It has already succeeded on that front. As of early February 2026, the company was in talks with SoftBank for an additional $30 billion and stands to get up to a total of $60 billion from Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft combined. OpenAI is now valued at over $500 billion , up from $300 billion in March 2025. The new structure also paves the way for an eventual initial public offering , which, if it happens, would not only help the company raise more capital through stock markets but would also increase the pressure to make money for its shareholders. OpenAI says the foundation’s endowment is worth about $130 billion . Those numbers are only estimates because OpenAI is a privately held company without publicly traded shares. That means these figures are based on market value estimates rather than any objective evidence, such as market capitalization. When he announced the new structure , California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, “We secured concessions that ensure charitable assets are used for their intended purpose.” He also predicted that “safety will be prioritized” and said the “top priority is, and always will be, protecting our kids.” Steps that might help keep people safe At the same time, several conditions in the OpenAI restructuring memo are designed to promote safety, including: A safety and security committee on the OpenAI Foundation board has the authority to “require mitigation measures” that could potentially include the halting of a release of new OpenAI products based on assessments of their risks. The for-profit OpenAI Group has its own board, which must consider only OpenAI’s mission – rather than financial issues – regarding safety and security issues. The OpenAI Foundation’s nonprofit board gets to appoint all members of the OpenAI Group’s for-profit board. But given that neither the mission of the foundation nor of the OpenAI group explicitly alludes to safety, it will be hard to hold their boards accountable for it. Furthermore, since all but one board member currently serve on both boards , it is hard to see how they might oversee themselves. And the memorandum signed by the California attorney general doesn’t indicate whether he was aware of the removal of any reference to safety from the mission statement. Identifying other paths OpenAI could have taken There are alternative models that I believe would serve the public interest better than this one. When Health Net, a California nonprofit health maintenance organization , converted to a for-profit insurance company in 1992, regulators required that 80% of its equity be transferred to another nonprofit health foundation . Unlike with OpenAI, the foundation had majority control after the transformation. A coalition of California nonprofits has argued that the attorney general should require OpenAI to transfer all of its assets to an independent nonprofit. Another example is The Philadelphia Inquirer . The Pennsylvania newspaper became a for-profit public benefit corporation in 2016. It belongs to the Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit. This structure allows Philadelphia’s biggest newspaper to attract investment without compromising its purpose – journalism serving the needs of its local communities. It’s become a model for potentially transforming the local news industry . At this point, I believe that the public bears the burden of two governance failures. One is that OpenAI’s board has apparently abandoned its mission of safety. And the other is that the attorneys general of California and Delaware have let that happen.

In a study published this week in Nature, a team from Peking University said it had developed a prototype networking capacity that could communicate over distances of more than 3,700km (2,300 miles). Quantum key distribution (QKD) is regarded as the gold standard for secure communication – any attempt at eavesdropping inevitably leaves detectable traces, regardless of distance or the number of intermediate devices involved. Advertisement But despite its theoretical promise, QKD has struggled to overcome barriers such as limited range, prohibitive equipment costs or the inability to serve multiple users efficiently. Existing systems rely on a series of “trusted relay nodes” – essentially stations that handle quantum keys along the route. Advertisement While functional, these nodes introduce potential security vulnerabilities, much like packages that change hands at multiple distribution centres.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story low-regulation transactions have long promised the ability to pay anyone in the world for anything. More than ever before, that anything includes human beings: victims of human trafficking forced into scam compounds and the sex trade on an industrial scale, bought and sold in crypto deals carried out with impunity , often in full public view. He Leaked the Secrets of a Southeast Asian Scam Compound. Then He Had to Get Out Alive By Andy Greenberg In new research published today, crypto-tracing firm Chainalysis found that crypto-funded transactions for human trafficking—largely forced laborers trapped in compounds across Southeast Asia and coerced into working as online scammers, as well as sex-trafficking prostitution rings—grew explosively in 2025. According to the firm&#x27;s analysis, based largely on tracing across blockchains the cryptocurrency those criminal operations use, researchers found that crypto transactions for human trafficking grew at least 85 percent year over year. The total amount of those transactions, Chainalysis says, is now at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually—though it declined to give an exact number for that sales total because it considered its measurements to be a conservative estimate that likely undercounts the true scale of the issue. “This is the continuation of a story of industrialized exploitation,” says Chainalysis analyst Tom McLouth. “The emergence of borderless, low-fee payments has created the opportunity for human trafficking to scale faster.” The human trafficking operations Chainalysis identified in its research were primarily Chinese-speaking criminal groups posting advertisements for their offerings to the messaging service Telegram . Many of the posts were found on “guarantee” black markets that run on Telegram channels, such as Xinbi Guarantee and the recently defunct Tudou Guarantee , which offer escrow services that accept and hold cryptocurrencies to prevent users from being defrauded. Chainalysis says it also identified other independent Telegram channels selling prostitution services. By identifying trafficking operations from those Telegram posts as well as information from law enforcement and other partner groups, the company&#x27;s analysts were able to trace the operations&#x27; transactions, which are almost entirely carried out with “ stablecoins ,” cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the US dollar to avoid volatility, such as Tether and USDC. Much of the profits from the human trafficking operations also flowed back into the same Telegram-based guarantee markets, which serve as vast, multibillion-dollar money laundering hubs, with vendors willing to offer cash in exchange for dirty crypto. The scam compounds across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos that exploit forced laborers, most often lured from South Asia and Africa with fraudulent job offers, have been a booming business for years. They now pull in tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually, more than any other form of cybercrime, and human rights groups have estimated that they&#x27;ve trapped hundreds of thousands of conscripted scammers. Chainalysis says, however, that the majority of the measurable growth it traced in crypto-funded human trafficking actually came from sex trafficking operations. It found detailed Chinese-language Telegram advertisements describing profiles of sex workers available by the hour, for more long-term arrangements, and even international services offering to fly sex workers to locations like Macao, Taiwan, Hong Kong, or other “overseas” destinations. Some advertisements made references to suspected sex trafficking of minors, such as “Lolitas” and “real high schoolers,” Chainalysis found. The company&#x27;s analysis of the operations&#x27; crypto transactions also make clear that their payments flow to entities that oversee large numbers of women and girls, not independent sex workers. Chainalysis found that 62 percent of transactions for the typical prostitution networks it examined were between $1,000 and $10,000, while for the international sex trafficking operations in particular, it found that nearly half of transactions topped $10,000, suggesting “organized criminal enterprises operating at scale,” as the company describes it. While crypto has likely fueled the growth of the sex trafficking trade, McLouth notes that the ability to track cryptocurrency across blockchains may have also exposed to scrutiny an industry that had long thrived in secret. “This is new visibility into one of the oldest crimes in in existence,” McLouth says. On the scam compound side of the human trafficking industry, Chainalysis also found Telegram messages offering payments for bringing a new forced laborer into a scam compound, between $8,888 (a number likely chosen due to Chinese cultural associations with the number eight bringing good luck) and $22,000 per individual worker. “Compound No. 7 is making a strong entry into the market. All agents are welcome to compare prices and inquire,” reads a translation of one Chinese-language Telegram message soliciting Chinese-speaking workers for a compound in Cambodia. “Typing skills are required, good health is required, standard Mandarin is required, no falsified documents, no mental problems is required. … Direct operation from the compound, personnel interviewed at the company, immediate payment.” As detailed by a whistleblower who contacted WIRED from within a scam compound last year, trafficked workers typically have their passports taken by scam compound bosses and are forced to work 15- or 16-hour shifts targeting Western victims with text-based scam messages. Some are held in debt bondage, while others are more explicitly imprisoned in walled compounds, beaten and electrocuted for violating rules or missing scam quotas. A Chinese-language post on Telegram offering sex workers, with descriptions of their measurements and sexual services they provide. Courtesy of Chainalysis The common threads across both the sexual exploitation and scam compound sides of the crypto-funded human trafficking industry are the use of Telegram as a market platform and stablecoins—particularly the popular stablecoin Tether, according to other reports—as their means of payment, points out Erin West, a former Santa Clara County, California, prosecutor who leads an anti-scam organization called Operation Shamrock. Both companies could do more to avoid enabling human traffickers, West says: Telegram could ban the traffickers&#x27; accounts, or Tether—which unlike Bitcoin functions as a centralized currency—could seize or freeze their assets. Yet she argues that both companies allow these criminal operations to continue to use their tools. When WIRED reached out to Tether about its role in the human trafficking operations, it responded in a statement that it “condemns human trafficking, forced labor, and sexual exploitation in the strongest possible terms and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward the misuse of USD₮ or any of its technology to facilitate these crimes.” It pointed to its cooperation with 330 law enforcement agencies around the world in more than 2,000 cases, and said it had frozen about $4 billion worth of Tether and reissued nearly $1 billion for asset recovery and victim restitution. Tether added that it works with and funds several UN programs focused on human trafficking and scams. “It is important to distinguish between criminal misuse of financial tools and the tools themselves,” Tether&#x27;s statement reads. “Stablecoins, like all widely used financial instruments, can be exploited by bad actors. However, public blockchains provide law enforcement with a level of transparency and traceability that is fundamentally unavailable in cash-based trafficking networks, which continue to dominate these crimes globally.” When WIRED reached out to Telegram, the company responded in a statement that “criminal activities—such as human trafficking or money laundering—are expressly forbidden by Telegram’s terms of service, and we remove such content immediately upon discovery.” It pointed to page of moderation statistics and its ban last May of the Telegram channels for Xinbi Guarantee as well as an even bigger black market, Huione Guarantee. (In fact, both markets bounced back in the months that followed, with Xinbi simply rebuilding its Telegram channels and Huione rebranding as Tudou Guarantee.) “These channels, however, are often the only effective means of moving money for people living under strict financial controls in countries such as China, so reports must be examined on a case-by-case basis,” Telegram&#x27;s statement continued. “In addition to accepting reports from users and NGOs, Telegram has a large team of moderators empowered by custom AI tools who proactively monitor the platform and remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.” Xinbi Guarantee, for its part, appears aware enough of its vulnerability to a more sustained Telegram ban that it&#x27;s moved some of its operations to a different messaging service called SafeW, as crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs recently noted, but largely still runs on Telegram. Chainalysis&#x27;s human trafficking research also touches on crypto&#x27;s use in the sale of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), which represent a far smaller total of crypto transactions, but one whose effects on its young victims can&#x27;t be measured in dollar amounts. Chainalysis found that about half of CSAM transactions are for less than $100, which it argues underscores how cheap and accessible CSAM materials—including AI generated ones —have become. More disturbingly, it points out that CSAM from “hurtcore” and other sadistic online communities that use sextortion tactics to force minors to film explicit videos of themselves is now increasingly resurfacing on commercial marketplaces where it&#x27;s sold for cryptocurrency. —a “privacy coin” designed to be far more difficult to trace—to launder their proceeds. The UK-based anti-CSAM nonprofit Internet Watch Foundation, which sometimes partners with Chainalysis in its research, says it&#x27;s seen a steady uptick in the use of crypto for CSAM sales since it first began tracking cryptocurrency markets for the materials five years ago. Despite Bitcoin&#x27;s traceability , its transnational payments lets operators pay to host CSAM in another country—often the US—making law enforcement operations more complex. “It&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s cross-border,” says one IWF analyst who asked to remain unnamed due to the sensitivity of their work. “You could be on one side of the world but run these services on the other side of the world.” Chainalysis argues that, as disturbing as crypto&#x27;s fueling of the human trafficking trade may be, it also presents opportunities for law enforcement to take on that industry. Some of the vulnerable points to target, says Chainalysis&#x27; McLouth, may include the centralized stablecoin crypto systems these traffickers use, as well the multibillion-dollar guarantee markets running on Telegram and serving as cash-out points for these industries of exploitation. “These are some of the premier opportunities for disruption from law enforcement,” says McLouth. “But they need to move faster. They need to put more resources into understanding how all this works. Because it&#x27;s only going to keep evolving.” Updated 9:16 am ET, February 12, 2026: Added comment from Tether.",

      "content": "Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before. The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect. Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention . But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had. PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs , hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out. The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London. Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017. Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready. Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.” At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024. In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to. Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted. BRIAN STAUFFER Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says. The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected? Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.) But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models , as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says. The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.” It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed. So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.” However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media . “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote. It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.” And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.” “We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote. Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.” Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.” Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.” BRIAN STAUFFER Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says. But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.” For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now. And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events. Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says. PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.” AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state. Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says. It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates. Artificial intelligence Four ways to think about this year&#x27;s reckoning.
