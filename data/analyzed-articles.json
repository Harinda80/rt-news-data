      "content": "We are calling on technology companies like Meta and Google to stand up for their users by resisting the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) lawless administrative subpoenas for user data. In the past year, DHS has consistently targeted people engaged in First Amendment activity. Among other things, the agency has issued subpoenas to technology companies to unmask or locate people who have documented ICE's activities in their community, criticized the government, or attended protests. These subpoenas are unlawful, and the government knows it. When a handful of users challenged a few of them in court with the help of ACLU affiliates in Northern California and Pennsylvania, DHS withdrew them rather than waiting for a decision. These subpoenas are unlawful, and the government knows it. But it is difficult for the average user to fight back on their own. Quashing a subpoena is a fast-moving process that requires lawyers and resources. Not everyone can afford a lawyer on a moment’s notice, and non-profits and pro-bono attorneys have already been stretched to near capacity during the Trump administration. That is why we, joined by the ACLU of Northern California, have asked several large tech platforms to do more to protect their users, including: Insist on court intervention and an order before complying with a DHS subpoena, because the agency has already proved that its legal process is often unlawful and unconstitutional; Give users as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena, so the user can seek help. While many companies have already made this promise , there are high-profile examples of it not happening—ultimately stripping users of their day in court; Resist gag orders that would prevent companies from notifying their users that they are a target of a subpoena. We sent the letter to Amazon, Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Reddit, SNAP, TikTok, and X. Recipients are not legally compelled to comply with administrative subpoenas absent a court order An administrative subpoena is an investigative tool available to federal agencies like DHS. Many times, these are sent to technology companies to obtain user data. A subpoena cannot be used to obtain the content of communications, but they have been used to try and obtain some basic subscriber information like name, address, IP address, length of service, and session times. Unlike a search warrant, an administrative subpoena is not approved by a judge. If a technology company refuses to comply, an agency’s only recourse is to drop it or go to court and try to convince a judge that the request is lawful. That is what we are asking companies to do—simply require court intervention and not obey in advance. It is unclear how many administrative subpoenas DHS has issued in the past year. Subpoenas can come from many places—including civil courts, grand juries, criminal trials, and administrative agencies like DHS. Altogether, Google received 28,622 and Meta received 14,520 subpoenas in the first half of 2025, according to their transparency reports. The numbers are not broken out by type. DHS is abusing its authority to issue subpoenas In the past year, DHS has used these subpoenas to target protected speech. The following are just a few of the known examples. On April 1, 2025, DHS sent a subpoena to Google in an attempt to locate a Cornell PhD student in the United States on a student visa. The student was likely targeted because of his brief attendance at a protest the year before. Google complied with the subpoena without giving the student an opportunity to challenge it. While Google promises to give users prior notice, it sometimes breaks that promise to avoid delay. This must stop. In September 2025, DHS sent a subpoena and summons to Meta to try to unmask anonymous users behind Instagram accounts that tracked ICE activity in communities in California and Pennsylvania . The users—with the help of the ACLU and its state affiliates— challenged the subpoenas in court, and DHS withdrew the subpoenas before a court could make a ruling. In the Pennsylvania case, DHS tried to use legal authority that its own inspector general had already criticized in a lengthy report. In October 2025, DHS sent Google a subpoena demanding information about a retiree who criticized the agency’s policies. The retiree had sent an email asking the agency to use common sense and decency in a high-profile asylum case. In a shocking turn, federal agents later appeared on that person’s doorstep. The ACLU is currently challenging the subpoena. Read the full letter here",

Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters View image in fullscreen Kwok Yin-sang, father of wanted US-based activist Anna Kwok, arrives at court in Hong Kong on 11 February. Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters Father of pro-democracy activist Anna Kwok first to be convicted under Hong Kong national security law Officials arrested Kwok Yin-sang after he tried to end his daughter’s insurance policy and withdraw the funds A Hong Kong court has found the father of a wanted activist guilty of a national security violation, after he tried to end her insurance policy and withdraw the funds, drawing international criticism for the targeting of relatives of pro-democracy campaigners. Kwok Yin-sang, 68, is the first person to be charged under a homegrown national security law , also known as Article 23, for “attempting to deal with, directly or indirectly, any funds or other financial assets or economic resources” belonging to an absconder. His daughter, Anna Kwok, helps lead the Washington-based advocacy group Hong Kong Democracy Council, and is one of 34 overseas activists wanted by Hong Kong national security police . She is accused of colluding with foreign forces and police have offered a bounty of HK$1m ($127,400) for her arrest. Rights groups condemn arrest of Hong Kong activist Anna Kwok’s father and brother Read more Kwok Yin-sang was accused of trying to withdraw funds totalling HK$88,609 ($11,342) from an education savings insurance policy which he bought for her when she was almost two years old. He had pleaded not guilty and did not testify at the trial. The acting principal magistrate Cheng Lim-chi said since Anna Kwok is a fugitive, directly or indirectly handling her insurance policy is illegal. A sentence is yet to be pronounced. According to the prosecution, when Kwok was arrested, he said under police caution: “I know my daughter is wanted by the security bureau. I was the one paying for her insurance policy. Since she’s no longer in Hong Kong, I just cut it.” Kwok Yin-sang had initially been denied bail but he was later granted bail by the high court with conditions imposed including a travel ban and a ban on communication with his daughter. During the closing submission, defence lawyer Steven Kwan argued that section 89 and 90 of Article 23 should not apply in a case where a person was simply handling an insurance policy he had bought a long time ago for his children. “This … is a form of prosecution based on family ties,” Kwan said. Anna Kwok’s brother was also arrested for the same crime and is now on bail. China imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020 and the city’s legislature passed a second set of national security laws known as Article 23 in 2024, to plug what authorities called “loopholes” in the national security regime.

      "content": "For thirty years, internet users have benefited from a key federal law that allows everyone to express themselves, find community, organize politically, and participate in society. Section 230 , which protects internet users’ speech by protecting the online intermediaries we rely on, is the legal support that sustains the internet as we know it. Yet as Section 230 turns 30 this week, there are bipartisan proposals in Congress to either repeal or sunset the law . These proposals seize upon legitimate concerns with the harmful and anti-competitive practices of the largest tech companies, but then misdirect that anger toward Section 230. But rolling back or eliminating Section 230 will not stop invasive corporate surveillance that harms all internet users. Killing Section 230 won’t end to the dominance of the current handful of large tech companies—it would cement their monopoly power . The current proposals also ignore a crucial question: what legal standard should replace Section 230? The bills provide no answer, refusing to grapple with the tradeoffs inherent in making online intermediaries liable for users’ speech. This glaring omission shows what these proposals really are: grievances masquerading as legislation, not serious policy. Especially when the speech problems with alternatives to Section 230’s immunity are readily apparent , both in the U.S. and around the world. Experience shows that those systems result in more censorship of internet users’ lawful speech. Let’s be clear: EFF defends Section 230 because it is the best available system to protect users’ speech online. By immunizing intermediaries for their users’ speech, Section 230 benefits users. Services can distribute our speech without filters, pre-clearance, or the threat of dubious takedown requests. Section 230 also directly protects internet users when they distribute other people’s speech online, such as when they reshare another users’ post or host a comment section on their blog. It was the danger of losing the internet as a forum for diverse political discourse and culture that led to the law in 1996. Congress created Section 230’s limited civil immunity because it recognized that promoting more user speech outweighed potential harms. Congress decided that when harmful speech occurs, it’s the speaker that should be held responsible—not the service that hosts the speech. The law also protects social platforms when they remove posts that are obscene or violate the services’ own standards. And Section 230 has limits: it does not immunize services if they violate federal criminal laws. Section 230 Alternatives Would Protect Less Speech With so much debate around the downsides of Section 230, it’s worth considering: What are some of the alternatives to immunity, and how would they shape the internet? The least protective legal regime for online speech would be strict liability. Here, intermediaries always would be liable for their users’ speech—regardless of whether they contributed to the harm, or even knew about the harmful speech. It would likely end the widespread availability and openness of social media and web hosting services we’re used to. Instead, services would not let users speak without vetting the content first, via upload filters or other means. Small intermediaries with niche communities may simply disappear under the weight of such heavy liability. Another alternative: Imposing legal duties on intermediaries, such as requiring that they act “reasonably” to limit harmful user content. This would likely result in platforms monitoring users’ speech before distributing it, and being extremely cautious about what they allow users to say. That inevitably would lead to the removal of lawful speech—probably on a large scale. Intermediaries would not be willing to defend their users’ speech in court, even it is entirely lawful. In a world where any service could be easily sued over user speech, only the biggest services will survive. They’re the ones that would have the legal and technical resources to weather the flood of lawsuits. Another option is a notice-and-takedown regime, like what exists under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That will also result in takedowns of legitimate speech. And there’s no doubt such a system will be abused. EFF has documented how the DMCA leads to widespread removal https://www.eff.org/takedowns of lawful speech based on frivolous copyright infringement claims. Replacing Section 230 with a takedown system will invite similar behavior, and powerful figures and government officials will use it to silence their critics . The closest alternative to Section 230’s immunity provides protections from liability until an impartial court has issued a full and final ruling that user-generated content is illegal, and ordered that it be removed. These systems ensure that intermediaries will not have to cave to frivolous claims. But they still leave open the potential for censorship because intermediaries are unlikely to fight every lawsuit that seeks to remove lawful speech. The cost of vindicating lawful speech in court may be too high for intermediaries to handle at scale. By contrast, immunity takes the variable of whether an intermediary will stand up for their users’ speech out of the equation. That is why Section 230 maximizes the ability for users to speak online. In some narrow situations, Section 230 may leave victims without a legal remedy. Proposals aimed at those gaps should be considered, though lawmakers should pay careful attention that in vindicating victims, they do not broadly censor users’ speech. But those legitimate concerns are not the criticisms that Congress is levying against Section 230. EFF will continue to fight for Section 230, as it remains the best available system to protect everyone’s ability to speak online.",

      "content": "New&nbsp; Israeli &nbsp;measures in the&nbsp; occupied West Bank will cement de facto annexation and bring an end to the Oslo Accords, analysts say, dashing hopes for a Palestinian state. Announced on Sunday , the sweeping changes expand Israel's civil control in Areas A and B - where all major Palestinian cities and towns are located - which since the Oslo Accords of 1993 have officially been under Palestinian Authority (PA) jurisdiction.&nbsp; The measures also make it easier for Jewish Israelis to privately own land in the West Bank, potentially accelerating settlement expansion.&nbsp; This is achieved by scrapping a law preventing the sale of Palestinian-owned land to Jewish Israelis, easing sales regulations, and lifting the confidentiality of land registration records - a move that could facilitate forgery of land purchase documents, a tactic commonly used by settlers. “The decision is among the most direct and dangerous steps taken [against Palestinians],\"&nbsp;Jamal Juma, a Palestinian coordinator at the Stop the Wall campaign, told Middle East Eye.&nbsp; New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters “In effect, it signals the end of everything introduced by the Oslo Accords and strips the Palestinian Authority of its powers.” 'The new measures effectively reduce the PA to little more than a security agent for Israel' -&nbsp; Jamal Juma, coordinator at Stop the Wall campaign Under the new unilaterally imposed arrangements, building licensing and construction in the southern West Bank city of Hebron will also be transferred from Palestinian authorities to the Israeli military.&nbsp; The transfer would allow Israeli changes in the Old City of Hebron, including the Ibrahimi Mosque, which violates the 1997 Hebron Protocol agreements between Israel and the PA.&nbsp; Israeli ministers and settler groups hailed the changes.&nbsp; Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right minister overseeing civilian affairs in the West Bank, vowed after the changes were announced to “continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state”. Regavim, a pro-settler group, said the new measures “mark a clear break from the Oslo framework”.&nbsp; The PA and nearly all Palestinian factions condemned the measures, calling them illegal steps aimed at deepening annexation and expanding settlements.&nbsp; Eight Muslim-majority countries - Egypt , Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Turkey and the United Arab Emirates - denounced the changes, saying they aim to “impose unlawful Israeli sovereignty” in the West Bank. De facto annexation&nbsp; For years, Israel has sought to annex the occupied West Bank, with officials and ministers publicly expressing support for such a move. In July, Israel’s parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling for the annexation of the territory.&nbsp; While the proposal carries no legal weight and does not alter the official status of the West Bank, it is widely seen as a symbolic step designed to build momentum towards future unilateral action. However, facing international pressure - especially from its ally, the United States - to avoid official annexation, the current Israeli government has taken several measures that make annexation a de facto reality. In September, Smotrich unveiled a plan to annex 82 percent of the West Bank and incorporate it into Israel.&nbsp; He said the plan was prepared by the Settlement Administration within the Ministry of Defence.&nbsp; The principle behind the plan is to take control of “maximum land with minimum [Palestinian] population,” gradually dismantling the PA, which serves as the internationally recognised governing body in parts of the West Bank. Juma, a long-time campaigner against settlement expansion, said Israel is advancing annexation on the ground through three parallel and mutually reinforcing tracks: settlement expansion, Palestinian displacement, and legal and administrative restructuring. Under the current government, which took office in early 2023, settlement expansion has reached its highest level since the UN began tracking such data in 2017.&nbsp; In 2025 alone, nearly 47,390 housing units were advanced, approved, or tendered, up from around 26,170 in 2024.&nbsp; By comparison, an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022.&nbsp; UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the expansion as “relentless”. Juma highlighted that settlement growth is supported by an “enormous” expansion of settler-only infrastructure across the West Bank, including roads, bridges and other projects linking settlements directly to Israel proper. The West Bank is also experiencing the largest wave of forced displacement in years, driven by military assaults in the north and settler violence. The changes to legal and administrative frameworks are only part of the broader Israeli policy to create a de facto reality of annexation, according to Juma. “Settlement expansion, Palestinian displacement, and legal restructuring are advancing in parallel, accelerating the annexation of the West Bank,” he said.&nbsp; “The latest measures take it further by targeting the future of the Palestinian Authority and governance in the territory.” PA 'cornered'&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most significant measures introduced on Sunday is the expansion of Israeli civil control into Areas A and B of the West Bank. Under the stated aims of protecting ancient sites, preventing water-related offences, and addressing environmental hazards, Israeli authorities would now be able to manage civilian affairs directly in major Palestinian cities.&nbsp; Services such as waste management and sewage are set to be coordinated directly with the Israeli military in some cities, bypassing the PA.&nbsp; “The new measures effectively reduce the PA to little more than a security agent for Israel, stripping it of virtually all administrative powers,” said Juma.&nbsp; He warned that the Palestinian Authority now faces an existential crisis, although it remains unclear what steps it will take. Following the announcement, Hussein al-Sheikh, deputy president of the PA, called on the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the UN Security Council to hold emergency sessions to “discuss and condemn” the Israeli decision and demand its reversal. “These decisions have cornered the PA,” Juma said.&nbsp; “It now has no real options: either it continues as a security agent for the occupation in every sense of the word, or it shifts towards a new Palestinian resistance plan to confront these measures.” Hebron targeted&nbsp; The new measures specifically target Hebron, introducing far-reaching changes to the city.&nbsp; The city is home to approximately 200,000 Palestinians and 700 Israeli settlers.&nbsp; For decades, it has been a focal point of Israeli settlement activity and is the only Palestinian city outside of East Jerusalem where settlers live within the urban centre. Most West Bank settlers live in outlying areas, away from major Palestinian towns. Hebron also contains the Ibrahimi Mosque, an ancient site revered by Muslims, Christians and Jews, and has long been the site of settler raids and takeover attempts. Following a 1994 massacre at the mosque by an Israeli settler, the city was divided into two areas under the Hebron Protocol agreements: H1, controlled by Palestinians, covering roughly 80 percent of the city; and H2, controlled by the Israeli military, covering 20 percent. 'For many years, the occupation ‘managed the conflict’ with Palestinians - but today they are moving toward resolving it through outright ethnic cleansing'&nbsp; -&nbsp;Hisham Sharabati, researcher&nbsp; The new measures transfer municipal powers in Hebron from the PA to Israeli authorities and place planning and service provision around the Ibrahimi Mosque under Israeli control, effectively dismantling the Hebron Protocol arrangements. Hisham Sharabati, a Hebron-based researcher with the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Centre (JLAC), told MEE that the latest move is part of a decades-long Israeli policy to ethnically cleanse the city. “The new changes mean the settlement planning council would oversee public spaces, road construction, and services in Hebron,” he said.&nbsp; “This will inevitably prioritise Israeli settlers over Palestinians, giving them legal control over areas that have long been Palestinian.” Sharabati warned that around 35,000 Palestinians living in H2, who have long endured heavy military restrictions, are likely to be the first affected.&nbsp; He also cautioned that similar measures could soon be extended to other Palestinian cities. “There is a campaign targeting the entire Palestinian presence in the West Bank,” he said. “This long-standing policy continues, but at an accelerated pace.&nbsp; “For many years, the occupation ‘managed the conflict’ with Palestinians - but today they are moving toward resolving it through outright ethnic cleansing, paving the way for annexation.” Middle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

      "content": "iStock/Rest of World The rapid expansion of artificial-intelligence infrastructure is triggering a global memory chip shortage, as factories prioritize chips for hyperscalers over the kinds used in laptops and smartphones. The shortage is set to have far-reaching global ramifications. The world’s two biggest memory chipmakers, South Korean companies Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, are making record sales.&nbsp; New memory chip plants are being announced in countries including Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. China, facing U.S. export controls, is racing to catch up in memory technology. The trend is expected to push up prices for consumer electronics globally, threatening the profitability of low-cost smartphones. Here’s how this memory crunch is playing out. Memory chips are a critical part of the semiconductor family. Made from silicon wafers, they store data and deliver it to processing units — the “brains” that perform computations.&nbsp; There are two major types of memory chips: Those with dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, which provides short-term memory for active programs, and chips that use NAND flash, which provides long-term storage for files. AI data centers rely on an ultrafast memory architecture called high-bandwidth memory. In HBM, DRAM chips are stacked vertically and placed next to the graphics processing unit. This structure is critical for running large language models, which constantly process massive data sets. Explore charts &gt;&gt; As the AI industry orders vast quantities of HBM chips, manufacturers are diverting capacity away from producing conventional DRAM and NAND chips used in consumer electronics. Prices for these memory chips are rising at historic rates. In the first quarter alone, DRAM and NAND flash prices are expected to rise by 90%–95% and 55%–60%, respectively, according to market research firm TrendForce. SK Hynix, Samsung, and U.S. company Micron account for more than 90% of global memory chip production. The companies are hitting record valuations amid surging demand. The three companies are all expanding production in Asia, where most semiconductor manufacturing takes place. Micron is planning additional facilities in the U.S., Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Samsung and SK Hynix are increasing capacity in South Korea.&nbsp; The rise of AI and its demand for computing power has given a boost to hardware suppliers in Asia, as some have taken the spotlight from internet companies that long dominated the region’s tech boom. Recently, SK Hynix and Samsung together surpassed the combined market capitalization of Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent for the very first time.&nbsp; China imports most of its memory chips, but it has been trying to make its own as part of the broader push for self-sufficiency in the AI industry. The U.S. in 2024 imposed restrictions on China’s access to HBM chips to limit its AI advancements.&nbsp; China’s homegrown DRAM maker, ChangXin Memory Technologies, is catching up to Korean rivals in producing HBM for AI chipsets, though it remains several years behind technologically. In September, research firm SemiAnalysis projected the company would account for nearly 15% of global DRAM production by 2026. Yangtze Memory Technologies, China’s leading NAND flash producer, is also ramping up construction of new fabrication plants. The company is planning to expand into DRAM chips for AI applications, according to Reuters.&nbsp; It will take years for chipmakers to build enough production lines to meet AI-driven demand. Until then, the memory crunch is expected to push up prices for computers, smartphones, tablets, and cars. Rising memory costs could make low-end devices economically unsustainable for electronics companies, according to Counterpoint Research. Some budget smartphones may be pulled from the market altogether as profit margins shrink. Counterpoint forecasts that global smartphone shipments will fall by 2.1% in 2026. Chinese brands including Honor, Vivo, and Oppo, which have large portfolios of budget models, are expected to be hit hardest by higher memory costs.",

Composite: Meanjin View image in fullscreen A new Meanjin editor will be recruited via a nationwide search when the publication relaunches in Queensland. Composite: Meanjin ‘A cultural icon’: axed Australian literary journal Meanjin finds new life in Queensland The 85-year-old magazine will return to the city for which it was named after a successful bid by Queensland University of Technology Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast The literary journal Meanjin will return to the city it was born in that bears its Indigenous name. The Queensland University of Technology announced on Wednesday it had acquired the 85-year-old journal, whose life was cut short by Melbourne University Press in September. QUT’s successful bid marked a full circle for Meanjin, which was founded in Brisbane/Meanjin by Clem Christesen in 1940 before moving to Melbourne in 1945. The QUT vice-chancellor, Prof Margaret Sheil, said the new ownership agreement committed to maintaining the journal’s rigorous standards by safeguarding its editorial independence and the appointment of a dedicated editorial board. “Meanjin has been instrumental in shaping Australian literary and intellectual culture for decades,” Sheil said. “It has provided a vital platform for critical discussion, a showcase of emerging writers and a valuable training ground for leading Australian publishers and editors. We are honoured to be entrusted with the legacy of this cultural icon.” A competitive nationwide search will be launched to recruit a new editor. MUP chair Professor Warren Bebbington said it received a number of offers to acquire the title, but it was QUT’s understanding of the journal’s legacy that put it ahead of the pack. Guardian Australia has sought clarification from QUT and MUP over who will hold the copyright to the journal’s extensive archives, entitling them to retain royalties that have been the source of a modest but steady stream of income since Meanjin became an imprint of Melbourne University Publishing in 2008. When MUP announced Meanjin’s demise last year, critics decried the decision as an act of cultural vandalism . At the time, Bebbington claimed the decision was made on “purely financial grounds,” leading to the redundancy of the staff. Meanjin’s outgoing editor, Esther Anatolis, declined to comment other than to say she was not informed of the ownership transfer. It remains unclear whether QUT plans to revive the First Nations and linguistically diverse advisory panel it used in its previous entity. Meanjin’s former poetry editor, former University of Melbourne associate professor Jeanine Leane, told the Guardian it was an “unfortunate coincidence” that MUP decided to close the journal just as it was moving toward prioritising First Nations writing. “I wasn’t privy to any of the discussions or decisions as they were made, and I know financial concerns were cited,” she said. “But Meanjin was a not-for-profit publication.” Bebbington’s justifications for closing Meanjin were greeted with much scepticism, given the journal had recently secured a $100,000 Creative Australia grant. There was speculation at the time that the University of Melbourne council had pressured MUP following a controversial essay by Max Kaiser regarding the Gaza conflict - a claim Professor Bebbington dismissed as “completely wrong”, insisting MUP acted independently in its decision. The University of Melbourne denied its council played any part in the decision to close the journal, which sparked fierce backlash from the literary community. Living Treasure Barry Jones and author Thomas Keneally lamented the loss of a “lodestar” for Australian writers. The former Labor attorney general and foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans personally wrote to the chief executive of MUP, condemning the decision as “bone-headed” . Meanjin will be housed in QUT’s School of Creative Arts, where it is expected to complement the school’s creative writing program. Australian books news Share Reuse this content",

      "content": "Advertisement Semiconductors Tech Big Tech China’s SMIC expects flat revenue as drop in low-end orders offsets AI chip growth The contract chipmaker’s profit falls short of analyst estimates amid ‘challenges’ brought on by memory supply crunch Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Ann Cao in Shanghai Published: 11:13am, 11 Feb 2026 Updated: 11:45am, 11 Feb 2026 Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), China’s largest contract chipmaker, said it expected first quarter revenue to remain flat as a decline in low-end orders partly offset surging demand for chips used in artificial intelligence applications. SMIC reported on Tuesday that 2025 revenue increased 16.2 per cent from a year earlier to US$9.3 billion, while net profit surged 39 per cent to US$685.1 million. The growth was mainly due to increases in wafer shipment and utilisation rate, as well as changes in product mix, SMIC said. However, profit for both the full year and the fourth quarter fell short of analyst estimates, and the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares dropped 3 per cent to HK$69.40 on Wednesday morning. Its Shanghai-listed stock fell 1.3 per cent to 114.70 yuan. Advertisement In an earnings call on Wednesday, Zhao Haijun, co-CEO of SMIC, said the company had seen orders from smartphone vendors and makers of other lower-end products “squeezed” by strong demand for AI chips, leading to the company’s flat revenue expectation. However, he added that the company was “still well positioned in the current industry development cycle”, adding that SMIC would proactively address urgent market demand to drive revenue growth in 2026. Advertisement The industry is in the grip of a massive supply crunch for memory chips, as a frantic ramp-up of production for advanced chips to feed demand from AI data centres eats up global wafer capacity and drives up costs across the supply chain.

Preliminary figures from the labour ministry show that inflation-adjusted wages shrank by 1.3 per cent last year, extending a three-year slide in real incomes as rising prices for essentials continued to outstrip pay increases. The average employee earned 355,919 yen (US$2,280) a month last year including bonuses and overtime – 2.3 per cent more in nominal terms, but still well behind inflation, which averaged just over 3 per cent. Advertisement The headline inflation rate, which exceeded the Bank of Japan’s 2 per cent target for the fourth year running, highlights the issue facing policymakers: long-sought price growth has finally returned, but at a pace that is undermining household purchasing power. A member of staff displays bags of rice a Lawson convenience store in Tokyo last year. Rice prices in Japan have soared by around two-thirds. Photo: AFP The sharpest price rises came in food staples and everyday items, with rice prices soaring by more than 60 per cent in 2025, alongside increases in coffee, chocolate and household goods.

Beijing’s annual work conference on Taiwan affairs, held on Monday and Tuesday, came just after Japan’s lower-house election, in which Takaichi’s party secured a two-thirds supermajority . At the event, Wang Huning , the Communist Party ’s fourth-ranked leader, reaffirmed Beijing’s long-term strategy for cross-strait relations. Advertisement Wang, who is chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference , mainland China’s top advisory body, said it was necessary to “firmly support the patriotic pro-unification forces on the island and resolutely strike against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces”. Wang also warned against “interference by external forces” and called for safeguarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Advertisement Analysts said the language used conveyed Beijing’s growing concern that expanding external security cooperation involving Taiwan could narrow its political and strategic room to manoeuvre.
