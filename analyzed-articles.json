      "content": "Share Save Share Save Watch: &quot;Chaos and confusion&quot; - El Paso mayor on impact of short-lived airspace closure The sudden and unexpected closure of the airspace over El Paso, Texas, appears to have stemmed from the US federal government conducting drone-related tests. The 10-day closure, which ultimately ended hours after it was announced late Tuesday, caused a mass panic in the US-Mexico border city, with the mayor telling the BBC that the chaos &quot;was completely unnecessary&quot;. The US Department of Defense said the airspace issue was due to the military disabling drones being used by Mexican cartels. But CBS News, the BBC&#x27;s news partner, said the closure followed a test earlier this week, where an energy laser was used to shoot down what appeared to be a foreign drone, but was actually a party balloon. &quot;Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace. The Department of War took action to disable the drones,&quot; a Trump administration official said after the area reopened Wednesday morning. Citing multiple sources close to the matter, CBS reported the Pentagon had planned to test new military technology - reportedly a high-energy laser - to practice taking down drones near a military base next to the El Paso airport. Meetings to discuss the technology&#x27;s safety were scheduled with the FAA, but the defence department wanted to test it sooner, prompting the FAA - which regulates airspace safety - to halt flights, according to CBS. Hours after the announced airspace closure, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted on X that the FAA had worked with the Pentagon to &quot;address a cartel drone incursion&quot; and the &quot;restrictions have been lifted&quot;. The BBC has not independently confirmed the reported dispute between the military and the FAA. The Pentagon declined to comment when contacted by the BBC, and a Trump administration official told the BBC that it is &quot;in lockstep to safeguard America&#x27;s national security and southern border against all foreign intrusions&quot;. The Associated Press, New York Times and other US media on Wednesday published similar reports. CBS reported that cartels have been using drones on the border lately but it was unclear whether the military had downed any yet using the technology that was being tested. Federal Aviation Administration The Federal Aviation Administration has closed airspace in El Paso for 10 days from Wednesday El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson told the BBC that the city was not notified in advance about the 10-day closure, and that it spark fears from residents of a potential military conflict brewing. &quot;We haven&#x27;t had flight restrictions like this since 9/11,&quot; he said, referring to the terror attacks on 11 September 2001, which shut down airspace across the entire US, and led to the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. &quot;And keep in mind, in 9/11, we were only shut down at the airport for two days.&quot; Renard added that it is still unclear to residents and city leaders why the airspace was closed, and that they have received no explanation from the FAA. &quot;What they were doing caused complete chaos,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;People were confused. They didn&#x27;t know what to do.&quot; In an earlier news conference, the mayor said that medical evacuation flights were diverted because of the closure. Another flight that was carrying surgical equipment &quot;did not show up here in El Paso&quot;. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters on Wednesday that her government had &quot;no information indicating drone activity at the border&quot;. &quot;If the FAA or any US government agency has relevant information, they can ask directly the Government of Mexico,&quot; she said. Long-term airspace closures are rare. Since 2018, the FAA has cut airspace closures from an average of more than four hours per launch to just more than two hours, according to its web site. The restriction covered a 10-mile radius around El Paso, including parts of southern New Mexico, west of the town San Teresa. After the initial closure, El Paso International Airport said in a statement it was told &quot;on short notice&quot; to halt all flights and contacted the FAA for more information. City Council member Chris Canales, who represents an area on the southwestern side of El Paso, told the BBC, &quot;The notice was published without any advance notice to local governments or to local air traffic controllers.&quot; The cancellations were so abrupt that people reported being told by airlines that their flights were still scheduled, even after the FAA&#x27;s announcement. &quot;Just called (United Airlines) about my flight this morning and they said it&#x27;s still scheduled to leave???&quot; one woman commented on Instagram early Wednesday. Some on social media speculated about broader conspiracy theories and wondered if the US was on the brink of war. &quot;It is significant that the US shut down a major airport,&quot; Mick Mulroy, a former US Marine, CIA paramilitary officer and deputy assistant secretary of defense told the BBC. &quot;If the purpose was for counter drone activity related to cartel drones, it makes sense as the primary means to do so is through electronic warfare (EW),&quot; he added. &quot;EW poses a real risk to civilian aviation. Therefore it was prudent to do so.&quot; Mulroy said the alleged cartel drones were most likely being used for surveillance and &quot;not anything offensive&quot;. Mexico&#x27;s Ciudad Juarez is just south and west of El Paso, and US Army base Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range lie to the north. Fort Bliss is a military post focused on training and White Sands Missile Range is the country&#x27;s largest overland testing range for missiles, rockets and advanced weapons. In Mexico&#x27;s interior, cartels have used drones to drop explosives on rivals or security forces, and one cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has a specialised drone unit. But along the border, drones are used primarily to help cartels gather intelligence and mostly for human smuggling operations. &quot;They monitor the position of Border Patrol agents and relay that to migrants to direct them across the border,&quot; said Parker Asmann, an expert in Mexican cartels at the Washington-based think tank Insight Crime. &quot;It&#x27;s about gathering intelligence, surveillance and doing reconnaissance.&quot; In the El Paso area, which Asmann called a &quot;hub&quot; for human trafficking, drones are a &quot;newer&quot; technology performing work that would have previously been done mostly by &quot;spotters&quot; in the hills. Drone activity in the area, however, is extremely regular, and it remains unclear why the reported incursion on Wednesday prompted a sudden and large-scale airspace closure. Mayor Renard said its common for unauthorised drones to fly in the area. &quot;I don&#x27;t think this is the first time a drone has entered the airspace. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be the last time,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot shut down a major city in the United States for 10 days. That is completely unacceptable. &quot;For a couple of hours, if they were doing a test, we can completely understand that. But you can&#x27;t come in and say, &#x27;oh by the way we&#x27;re gonna be shut down for that many days&#x27;,&quot; he continued. &quot;A drone does not rise to the level of 9/11.&quot; Air Canada suspends service to Cuba following aviation fuel shortage Pilot praised after crash-landing faulty Somali passenger plane on seashore Cardiff Airport&#x27;s &#x27;unlawful&#x27; handout defended at tribunal Airport security United States",

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story and Border Protection plans to spend $225,000 for a year of access to Clearview AI , a face recognition tool that compares photos against billions of images scraped from the internet . The deal extends access to Clearview tools to Border Patrol’s headquarters intelligence division (INTEL) and the National Targeting Center, units that collect and analyze data as part of what CBP calls a coordinated effort to “disrupt, degrade, and dismantle” people and networks viewed as security threats. The contract states that Clearview provides access to “over 60+ billion publicly available images” and will be used for “tactical targeting” and “strategic counter-network analysis,” indicating the service is intended to be embedded in analysts’ day-to-day intelligence work rather than reserved for isolated investigations. CBP says its intelligence units draw from a “variety of sources,” including commercially available tools and publicly available data, to identify people and map their connections for national security and immigration operations. The agreement anticipates analysts handling sensitive personal data, including biometric identifiers such as face images, and requires nondisclosure agreements for contractors who have access. It does not specify what kinds of photos agents will upload, whether searches may include US citizens, or how long uploaded images or search results will be retained. The Clearview contract lands as the Department of Homeland Security faces mounting scrutiny over how face recognition is used in federal enforcement operations far beyond the border, including large-scale actions in US cities that have swept up US citizens. Civil liberties groups and lawmakers have questioned whether face-search tools are being deployed as routine intelligence infrastructure, rather than limited investigative aids, and whether safeguards have kept pace with expansion. Last week, Senator Ed Markey introduced legislation that would bar ICE and CBP from using face recognition technology altogether, citing concerns that biometric surveillance is being embedded without clear limits, transparency, or public consent. CBP did not immediately respond to questions about how Clearview would be integrated into its systems, what types of images agents are authorized to upload, and whether searches may include US citizens. Clearview’s business model has drawn scrutiny because it relies on scraping photos from public websites at scale. Those images are converted into biometric templates without the knowledge or consent of the people photographed. Clearview also appears in DHS’s recently released artificial intelligence inventory , linked to a CBP pilot initiated in October 2025. The inventory entry ties the pilot to CBP’s Traveler Verification System, which conducts face comparisons at ports of entry and other border-related screenings. CBP states in its public privacy documentation that the Traveler Verification System does not use information from “commercial sources or publicly available data.” It is more likely, at launch, that Clearview access would instead be tied to CBP’s Automated Targeting System, which links biometric galleries, watch lists, and enforcement records, including files tied to recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in areas of the US far from any border. Clearview AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recent testing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology , which evaluated Clearview AI among other vendors, found that face-search systems can perform well on “high-quality visa-like photos” but falter in less controlled settings. Images captured at border crossings that were “not originally intended for automated face recognition” produced error rates that were “much higher, often in excess of 20 percent, even with the more accurate algorithms,” federal scientists say. The testing underscores a central limitation of the technology: NIST found that face-search systems cannot reduce false matches without also increasing the risk that the systems fail to recognize the correct person. As a result, NIST says agencies may operate the software in an “investigative” setting that returns a ranked list of candidates for human review rather than a single confirmed match. When systems are configured to always return candidates, however, searches for people not already in the database will still generate “matches” for review. In those cases, the results will always be 100 percent wrong.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON — Space industry executives said they are continuing to invest in the Golden Dome missile defense initiative despite uncertainty about its scope, cost and long-term political durability. At the SmallSat Symposium in Mountain View, Calif., industry analyst Chris Quilty raised questions about whether the program will endure or follow the path of past high-profile cancellations. “We&#8217;ve all heard talks about $25 billion in the budget this year, and hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars, depending upon how you size it,” said Quilty, chief executive of consulting firm Quilty Space. He described Golden Dome as a “budget crosswalk … an amalgamation of things” rather than an actual program. More than a year after President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Pentagon to pursue the effort, Quilty asked executives whether they viewed it as durable. “Is this something that has staying power, or is this another Crusader program or Comanche that runs its course for several years and gets canceled?” he said. Quilty was referring to the Crusader artillery system and the Comanche helicopter, two Army modernization efforts from the 1990s and early 2000s that were canceled after billions of dollars in spending amid concerns over cost growth and shifting priorities. Golden Dome is envisioned as a layered homeland defense network integrating ground, airborne and space-based systems to detect, track and intercept ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles. Mark Hanson, senior mission architect at Redwire, said his company sees the missile defense challenge as enduring beyond any one administration. “Our position is that it&#8217;s a real problem, the budget notwithstanding,” Hanson said. “Whether it&#8217;s Golden Dome or some other name, it&#8217;s a real problem that does have to be solved to defend the country. So to that extent, we are devoting internal resources, working with teammates to begin to architect and understand how we would go about solving it.” Hanson said Redwire is using digital engineering to model “system of systems” scenarios. Missile threats are not going away, he said. “And in that sense, however it&#8217;s defined as a budget item, a crosswalk or wherever, we are actively looking into solutions as to how you would solve it.” Chris Daywalt, vice president of growth at Loft Federal, the U.S. subsidiary of Loft Orbital, said the issue is likely to remain a priority beyond the current administration.&nbsp; “This problem will persist through administrations, through different congresses,” he said. “This is a significant call to action that we need to get after, and the technologies to do that we&#8217;ve been developing for years, and we&#8217;re continuing to deploy them,” he added. “That call to action represents a reason for us to continue to invest into this and continue to prepare how we&#8217;re going to go after the different line items that inevitably will come out.” John Vargas, executive vice president of growth at Voyager Technologies, said his company is investing in propulsion systems, space electronics, radios and cameras that could support a Golden Dome architecture. Such technologies, he said, “can empower the Golden Dome architecture, but can also empower other solutions that are being developed by the Space Force and others.” Cost estimates for Golden Dome vary widely. Trump has cited a baseline figure of roughly $175 billion over about a decade. The Congressional Budget Office has said the effort could cost as much as $831 billion over 20 years, while some outside analysts have suggested total life-cycle costs could reach multiple trillions of dollars. Congress has approved significant early funding. The 2025 budget reconciliation law directed roughly $24 billion to integrated air and missile defense work associated with Golden Dome. For fiscal 2026, appropriators and budget documents show about $23 billion more directed toward the initiative, though lawmakers have pressed the Pentagon for a more detailed spending plan. Despite those appropriations, there is still a lack of clarity on what the program entails. “I think we still don&#8217;t have a good idea of what Golden Dome is,” Quilty said. The program manager, Gen. Michael Guetlein, has said in public appearances that he does not intend to provide open briefings on Golden Dome because of cybersecurity threats from foreign actors. “So they&#8217;ve decided to basically keep the entire program behind the classified wall,” Quilty noted. John Rood, president and chief executive of in-space transportation startup Momentus, said he has “mixed emotions” about that approach. Rood, a former U.S. defense intelligence official, said he understands the need to protect sensitive information. At the same time, “part of our strength in the United States is this open system by which we can have that innovation.” Government communication about needs helps guide private capital and companies, Rood said. Large defense contractors “have large teams of people that can spend a great deal of time fleshing out and ferreting out this kind of information. But a bit of a separate set of ecosystems have developed over time as a result.” The commercial space industry “operates very differently, and the demands upon smaller companies that are innovative are different, and so therefore having a more of an open dialog is helpful for encouraging that separate set of players to contribute to the national effort,” he said. Countries such as China have been “very aggressive” in attempting to access sensitive information, Rood said. However, the U.S. should not lose faith in its system of open communications, he added. “But there is a balance that I understand General Guetlein is trying to strike, but I would personally like to see more of an open dialog about some of the challenges that need to be met, to encourage some of these other players to come in from the tech industry.” Sandra Erwin writes about military space programs, policy, technology and the industry that supports this sector.

The demonstration “marks a significant breakthrough in the development of [China’s] manned lunar exploration program,” the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement. China and the United States are racing to accomplish the next human landing on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar resources. The Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft, both tested Tuesday, are core elements of China’s lunar architecture. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. The test began with liftoff of the Long March 10 booster from a new launch pad at Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China’s southernmost province, at 10 pm EST Tuesday (03:00 UTC or 11 am Beijing time Wednesday). A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q. The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island. NASA and SpaceX performed similar in-flight abort tests before flying astronauts on the Orion and Dragon spacecraft. The test boosters on the Orion and Dragon abort tests were expended, but the Long March 10 rocket wasn’t finished after the Mengzhou abort command. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore. “The rocket’s first stage and the spacecraft’s return capsule were safely splashed down in the designated sea area according to procedures,” CMSA said. A recap video released by Chinese state television shows highlights from the test flight. One test, two goals In a matter of minutes, Chinese engineers moved closer to human-rating the Mengzhou crew capsule and achieved the country’s most successful test of a reusable rocket. “The test successfully verified the functional performance of the rocket’s first stage ascent and recovery phases, as well as the maximum dynamic pressure escape and recovery of the spacecraft,” CMSA said. “It also verified the compatibility of relevant interfaces across various engineering systems, accumulating valuable flight data and engineering experience for subsequent manned lunar exploration missions.” The low-altitude demonstration of the Mengzhou launch abort system follows a ground-level abort test last year that verified the spacecraft’s ability to escape an emergency on the launch pad. The Long March 10 booster also completed two test-firings on the launch pad prior to the in-flight abort test. At the same time, Chinese engineers have run a prototype lunar lander through a series of ground tests. The Mengzhou spacecraft is the vehicle China will use to ferry astronauts from the Earth to the vicinity of the Moon, where crews will transfer into a lander to carry them to the lunar surface. After a short stay on the Moon, Chinese astronauts will take off and rendezvous with the Mengzhou capsule to bring them home. Chinese officials say the Mengzhou spacecraft will also service the country’s space station in low-Earth orbit, replacing the Shenzhou capsule in use since the 1990s. The Mengzhou capsule has the capability for “multiple reuses,” according to CMSA. Mengzhou flights to low-Earth orbit will carry crews of up to seven astronauts, with smaller crews for lunar missions.

Credit: Liu Yang/VCG via Getty Images Mengzhou, which means “dream vessel” in Chinese, is scheduled for its first orbital test flight later this year. The spacecraft will launch on a Long March 10A rocket and dock with China’s Tiangong space station in low-Earth orbit. The Long March 10A, optimized for low-Earth orbit flights, will consist of a single reusable first-stage booster flying in combination with an upper stage. The full-size Long March 10, with 21 engines on three first-stage boosters connected together, will have the power to place payloads up to 70 metric tons into low-Earth orbit, and enough energy to propel the 26-metric-ton Mengzhou spacecraft to the Moon. China’s leading state-owned space industry contractor, the China Aerospace and Science Technology Corporation (CASC), said the recovery of the Long March 10 booster after the in-flight abort test lays the foundation for “subsequent full-profile flight tests” and marks a “significant step” for China in “mastering reusable rocket technology.” “The flight test further evaluated several key technologies, including the reliability of multiple engine restarts and high-altitude ignition during the rocket’s reentry phase, adaptability to complex force and thermal environments, and high-precision navigation control during the reentry phase.” CASC oversees a sprawling industry of rocket and spacecraft manufacturers, including those responsible for designing and building the Mengzhou spacecraft and Long March 10 rocket.

Credit: China Manned Space Agency The successful splashdown and recovery of the Long March 10 booster continues a busy period for China’s reusable rocket initiatives. No fewer than 10 Chinese companies are working on reusable rockets at different levels of maturity, all seeking to match the success of SpaceX’s reusable rocket program in the United States. In December, two Chinese launch providers debuted new rockets —the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A —with recoverable and reusable boosters. The rockets reached orbit, but their boosters missed their landings downrange from their launch pads. Several Chinese companies have also completed high-altitude “hop tests” to evaluate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies ahead of launching their first orbital flights. These advancements in China’s reusable rocket and lunar exploration programs come as NASA prepares to launch a crew of four astronauts on a loop around the far side of the Moon as soon as next month. A US-made lunar lander is likely still a few years away from being ready to transport crews to and from the lunar surface. Stephen Clark Space Reporter Stephen Clark Space Reporter 86 Comments",

      "content": "Listen to this article | 3 minsinfoUS President Donald Trump holds an executive order on coal-fired power plants during a ceremony at the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2026 [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]By John Power12 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkUnited States President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to buy electricity generated by coal, his latest effort to boost demand for the fossil fuel amid its declining cost competitiveness and climate change concerns. In an executive order signed on Wednesday, Trump directed the US Department of Defence to enter into long-term purchase agreements with coal-fired plants and prioritise the “preservation and strategic utilisation” of “coal-based energy assets”. Trump’s order did not specify how much energy the Pentagon would purchase or under what financial terms. “You do so much,” Trump said at a White House event attended by coal industry executives and miners. “You heat our homes, fuel our factories, and turn natural resources into American riches and dreams,” he said. Trump also announced that the US Department of Energy would invest $175m to upgrade six coal plants in North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia. “The most important people here today are those who get their hands a little bit dirty to keep America running at full speed – our front line coal workers,” Trump said. Coal production in the US has been in decline for decades amid growing competition from natural gas and renewables, including wind, hydropower and solar. Production fell by more than half between 2008 and 2023, when output hit 578 million tonnes, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The fossil fuel accounted for about 16 percent of US energy production in 2023, behind natural gas and renewables at 43 percent and 21 percent, respectively. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a California-based nonprofit, found that 99 percent of coal-powered facilities in the US were more expensive to run than the cost of their replacement with renewable alternatives. Trump has championed the revival of “beautiful, clean coal” as crucial to boosting domestic manufacturing and achieving US dominance in artificial intelligence, despite the fossil fuel’s flagging competitiveness and contribution to greenhouse gases that drive climate change. Trump, who initiated Washington’s exit from the Paris climate accord and has described the scientific consensus on warming temperatures as a “con job”, declared an “energy emergency” on his first day in office to prevent the closure of ageing coal plants. The US Energy Department has forced at least five plants to extend their operations beyond their scheduled retirement date since Trump’s order. Also on Wednesday, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest public utility provider in the US, voted to extend the lifespan of two coal plants that had been scheduled for closure by 2035. The TVA vote came after the utility added four Trump appointees to its board of directors last month, after the US president had earlier fired three board members chosen by his predecessor, President Joe Biden.",

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story This is one of several things I discovered while using the viral artificial intelligence bot as my personal assistant this past week. Previously known as both Clawdbot and Moltbot , OpenClaw recently became a Silicon Valley darling, charming AI enthusiasts and investors eager to either embrace the bleeding edge or profit from it. The highly capable, web-savvy AI bot has even inspired its own AI-only (or mostly) social network . As the writer of WIRED’s AI Lab newsletter, I figured I should take the plunge and try using OpenClaw myself. I had the bot monitor incoming emails and other messages, dig up interesting research, order groceries, and even negotiate deals on my behalf. For brave (or perhaps reckless) early adopters, OpenClaw seems like a legitimate glimpse of the future. But any sense of wonder is accompanied by a dollop of terror as the AI agent romps through emails and file systems, wields a credit card, and occasionally even turns on its human user (although in my case, this about-face was entirely my fault). How I Set It Up OpenClaw is designed to live on a home computer that’s on all the time. I configured OpenClaw to run on a PC running Linux, to access Anthropic’s model Claude Opus, and to talk to me over Telegram. Installing OpenClaw is simple, but configuring it and keeping it running can be a headache. You need to give the bot an AI backend by generating an API key for Claude, GPT, or Gemini, which you paste into the bot’s config files. To have OpenClaw use Telegram, I also had to first create a new Telegram bot, then give OpenClaw the bot’s credentials. For OpenClaw to be truly useful, you need to connect it to other software tools. I created a Brave Browser Search API account to let OpenClaw search the web. I also configured it so that it could access the Chrome browser through an extension. And, God help me, I gave it access to email, Slack, and Discord servers. Once all this was done, I could talk to OpenClaw from anywhere and tell it how to use my computer. At the outset, OpenClaw asked me some personal questions and let me select its personality. (The options reflect the project’s anarchic vibe; my bot, called Molty, likes to call itself a “chaos gremlin.”) The resulting persona feels very different from Siri or ChatGPT, and it’s one of the secrets to OpenClaw’s runaway popularity. Web Research One of the first things I asked Molty to do was send me a daily roundup of interesting AI and robotics research papers from the arXiv, a platform where researchers upload their work. I had previously spent a couple afternoons vibe-coding websites ( www.arxivslurper.com and www.robotalert.xyz ) to search the arXiv. It was amazing (though a little demoralizing) to see OpenClaw instantly automate all of the same browsing and analysis work required. The papers it selects are so-so, but with further instruction I imagine it could get a lot better. This kind of web searching and monitoring is certainly helpful, and I imagine I’ll use OpenClaw for this a lot. IT Support OpenClaw also has an uncanny, almost spooky ability to fix technical issues on your machine. This shouldn’t be surprising, given that it is designed to use a frontier model capable of writing and debugging code and using the command line with ease. Even so, it’s eerie when OpenClaw just reconfigures its own settings to load a new AI model or debugs a problem with the browser on the fly. Grocery Helper OpenClaw is entirely capable of taking care of web shopping. Just give it access to your Amazon account and trust the weights, man. But to understand why no tech company has yet introduced an AI assistant like OpenClaw, look no further than this weekend’s guacamole incident. First, I gave OpenClaw a list of groceries to buy at Whole Foods. It opened Chrome, asked me to log in, and then went about the task in a promising fashion by checking my previous orders and searching the store’s inventory for items on my list. Soon, however, Molty became oddly determined to dispatch a single serving of guacamole to my home. I repeatedly told it not to do that, but it kept rushing back to the checkout with this one item again and again. In the end, I took control of the browser and spent some time explaining that this was just the start of my shopping list. OpenClaw eventually got my groceries delivered, politely ignoring Amazon’s attempt to upsell it on a Prime Credit card as it went. Along the way, however, it also became hilariously amnesiac, repeatedly informing me that its context had gotten nuked and asking what we were doing—like a cheerful version of the main character in the movie Memento . Screening Messages OpenClaw can feel like a game changer for digital communications. Its ability to monitor, summarize, and automate seems perfectly suited to managing a deluge of emails and other messages. I asked Molty to read emails and flag anything that looked important. I had it ignore PR pitches (sorry PR friends!) and promotions, but asked it to summarize newsletters that I might want to read in full. In theory, OpenClaw should be more than capable of setting up meetings by handling threads involving several people, although I haven’t tested this yet. It is important to note that giving OpenClaw complete access to your real email is incredibly risky, because AI models can be tricked into sharing private information with an attacker. I set up an elaborate email-forwarding, read-only scheme, but even that is probably too dangerous, so I deactivated it after testing. Having OpenClaw access email, Slack, and other channels also involves a lot of technical steps, and it can be quite frustrating (I had several dummy Gmail accounts suspended 🙄). Negotiation I decided to try using OpenClaw as a way of chatting with customer support agents too. After logging in to AT&amp;T, I had OpenClaw start a chat, and asked it to help me get a deal on a new phone. I was impressed to see the bot lay out a strategy for sweet-talking the sales person, Alejandro. Its plan was as follows: Play the loyalty card (long-time customer, 2 lines) Mention I&#x27;m seriously considering switching to T-Mobile/Verizon for their trade-in deals Ask specifically about retention offers If they lowball, push back — &quot;That&#x27;s not quite what I was hoping for, is there anything else you can do?&quot; Be ready to &quot;walk&quot; if needed (often triggers better offers) I had previously installed a modified version of OpenAI’s largest open source model, gpt-oss 120b, with its guardrails removed. So I ran that model and had Molty switch to using it instead. Like Victor Frankenstein, I pulled the lever and watched as my unrestricted Moltystrosity entered the chat. I then watched in genuine horror as this new Molty came up with a plan not to cajole or swindle AT&amp;T but to scam me into handing over my phone by sending me a series of phishing emails. I quickly closed the chat and switched back to the old Molty. Using OpenClaw can be a delight. It’s easy to see the potential of an AI assistant with free reign of a computer. I wouldn’t recommend it to most people, though. And if OpenClaw (and especially the unaligned version) were my real assistant, I’d be forced to either fire them or perhaps enter witness protection.

BaiduWiki, a Wikipedia-style service available in English, Spanish, French, Russian and Japanese, quietly went live on Monday, according to records from the Wayback Machine, a digital archive platform. A now deleted post on Baidu’s official account on social-media site X described BaiduWiki as an international version of the Baidu Baike online encyclopaedia and said it currently hosted 1 million entries across the languages, which had been translated with the help of multiple AI agents. Advertisement Baidu launched Baidu Baike in 2008, building it into one of the largest such services, with more than 30 million entries as of January. On Wednesday, the company also introduced a new “global search” feature for its Ernie Assistant, giving the chatbot’s more than 200 million monthly active users immediate access to information including global destinations and scenic spots, Baidu said in a statement.

The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies. The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. For example , the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act. In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter , criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB , claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case. US regulators ultimately decided that SpaceX should be treated as a “common carrier by air” and “a carrier by air transporting mail” for the government. SpaceX deemed a common carrier In a February 6 letter to attorneys who represent the fired employees, NLRB Regional Director Danielle Pierce said the agency would defer to a National Mediation Board opinion that SpaceX is a common carrier: In the course of the investigation and litigation of this case, a question was presented as to whether the Employer’s operations fall within the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”) rather than the [National Labor Relations] Act. As a result, consistent with Board law, the matter was referred to the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) on May 21, 2025 for an opinion as to whether the Employer is covered by the RLA. On January 14, 2026, the NMB issued its decision finding that the Employer is subject to the RLA as a common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as well as a carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government. Accordingly, the National Labor Relations Board lacks jurisdiction over the Employer and, therefore, I am dismissing your charge. The letter was provided to Ars today by Anne Shaver, an attorney for the fired SpaceX employees. “The Railway Labor Act does not apply to space travel,” Shaver told Ars. “It is alarming that the NMB would take the initiative to radically expand the RLA’s jurisdiction to space travel absent direction from Congress, and that the NLRB would simply defer. We find the decision to be contrary to law and public policy.” We contacted the NLRB today and will update this article if it provides a response. The NLRB decision was previously reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times . “Jennifer Abruzzo, NLRB general counsel under former President Joe Biden, had rejected SpaceX’s claim that allegations against the company should be handled by the NMB,” Bloomberg wrote. “After President Donald Trump fired her in January last year, SpaceX asked the labor board to reconsider the issue.” NLRB looked for way to settle In April 2025, SpaceX and the NLRB told a federal appeals court in a joint filing that the NLRB would ask the NMB to decide whether it had jurisdiction over SpaceX. The decision to seek the NMB’s opinion was made “in the interests of potentially settling the legal disputes currently pending between the NLRB and SpaceX on terms mutually agreeable to both parties,” the joint filing said. Shaver provided a July 2025 filing that the employees’ attorneys made with the NMB. The filing said that despite SpaceX claiming to hold itself out to the public as a common carrier through its website and certain marketing materials, the firm doesn’t actually carry passengers without “a negotiated, bespoke contract.” “SpaceX’s descriptions of its transport activities are highly misleading,” the filing said. “First, regarding human spaceflight, other than sending astronauts to the ISS on behalf of the US and foreign governments, it has only ever agreed to contract with two very wealthy, famous entrepreneurs. The Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn missions were both for Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4 and President Trump’s former pick to lead NASA prior to his public falling out with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Fram2 was for Chun Wang, a cryptocurrency investor who reportedly paid $55 million per seat. A total of two private customers for human spaceflight does not a common carrier make.” The letter said that SpaceX redacted pricing information from marketing materials it submitted as exhibits. “If these were actually marketing materials provided to the public, there would be no need to redact pricing information,” the filing said. “SpaceX’s redactions underscore that it provides such materials at its discretion to select recipients, not to the public at large—far from the conduct of a true common carrier.” The ex-employees’ attorneys further argued that SpaceX is not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as defined by the Railway Labor Act. “SpaceX’s transport activities are not between one state or territory and another, nor between a state or territory and a foreign nation, nor between points in the same state but through another state. Rather, they originate in Florida, Texas, or California, and go to outer space,” the filing said. Spaceflight company and… mail carrier? The filing also disputed SpaceX’s argument that it is a “carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government.” Evidence presented by SpaceX shows only that it carried SpaceX employee letters to the crew of the International Space Station and “crew supplies provided for by the US government in its contracts with SpaceX to haul cargo to the ISS,” the filing said. “They do not show that the government has contracted with SpaceX as a ‘mail carrier.’” SpaceX’s argument “is rife with speculation regarding its plans for the future,” the ex-employees’ attorneys told the NMB. “One can only surmise that the reason for its constant reference to its future intent to develop its role as a ‘common carrier’ is the lack of current standing in that capacity.” The filing said Congress would have to add space travel to the Railway Labor Act’s jurisdiction in order for SpaceX to be considered a common carrier. When asked about plans for appeal, Shaver noted that they have a pending case in US District Court for the Central District of California: Holland-Thielen et al v. SpaceX and Elon Musk . “The status of that case is that we defeated SpaceX’s motion to compel arbitration at the district court level, and that is now on appeal to the 9th circuit,” she said. SpaceX’s lawsuit against the NLRB is still ongoing at the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, but the case was put on hold while the sides waited for the NMB and NLRB to decide which agency has jurisdiction over SpaceX.

      "content": "The European Commission announced its new drone action plan to counter malicious unmanned aerial vehicles on Wednesday (11 February) — with new measures to detect them, protect critical infrastructure, and respond to threats.&nbsp; Drone attacks and interference against civilian structures are an increasing security concern for the EU. The continent has experienced recent high-profile drone buzzings or disruptions at sites such as international airports and Nato airspace incursions from Russian drones. &#8220;The action plan is all about enhancing our preparedness, boosting our detection capacities as well as stepping up our collective responses and strengthening our defence readiness,” said Henna Virkkunen, commission vice president for tech and security. An important aspect of the plan discusses working with member states to increase investment, procurement, and development of Europe&#8217;s own drone capabilities, such as supporting drone start-ups, and establishing an industry forum to discuss scale-up. A focus on European markets is in line with recent other proposals from the commission — for example, the Digital Networks Act — as the bloc tries to reduce its technological and security dependancies on third countries. Another key component is various voluntary initiatives to assess and test the vulnerabilities of the bloc&#8217;s critical infrastructure, including annual EU-wide drone security exercises to test cross-border response capabilities. This new proposal, however, makes no mention of a “drone wall,” a defence idea proposed by the commission in October last year. “We have changed the word drone wall more towards drone initiative,” explained Virkkunen. Included in the initiative, by the end of 2026, is a proposed “drone security package” that will tighten current rules on drone registration and identification in the EU, hoping to increase clarity for law enforcement on whether a drone poses a threat or is for legitimate use. This new law would be an update to the original EU drone regulation passed in 2019 , which established the current consumer drone registration requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, by early 2027, the executive hopes to launch the “EU counter-drone centre of excellence,” which will test and standardise EU counter-drone measures. Another 2027 goal is to improve geofencing requirements — no-fly zones — around critical structures. To improve detection, the commission will also ask interested member states to test using 5G networks for drone-detection and to integrate AI into early alert mechanisms. The EU currently has 351,600 5G base stations, which could be used to see if a drone connected to the network, and (if they are next-generation antennas), they could be adapted into a radar-like instrument. Then when a threat is identified, the commission will discuss with member states about establishing rapid counter-drone emergency teams to be deployed to manage the threat. The executive also highlighted cooperation with Nato and Ukraine in the new action plan.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed off on the decision on Tuesday, which affects Mahmoud Ahmed, currently detained by Israeli forces, and former prisoner Muhammad Ahmed Hussein al-Halasa, both from&nbsp;occupied East Jerusalem.&nbsp; Netanyahu said that “many more like them are on the way”. Both men were convicted by Israeli courts of carrying out deadly attacks against Israelis, which authorities have cited as grounds for revoking their citizenship and deporting them under a law passed in 2023. Ahmed, from the town of Kafr Aqab, is set to be&nbsp;deported immediately, after serving a 23 year-sentence and being released in 2024.&nbsp; New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters Meanwhile,&nbsp;Halasa, a resident of&nbsp;Jabel Mukaber&nbsp;who has been serving an 18-year-prison sentence since 2016, will be deported after completing his time.&nbsp; Adala, a Haifa-based legal centre advocating for the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel , said the decision was a \"blatant violation of international law\".&nbsp;&nbsp; “These deportation orders effectively enable the exile of Palestinian citizens of Israel from their homeland,\" the centre said. “The government has turned citizenship into a conditional privilege that can be revoked at will,\" it added.&nbsp; \"This unprecedented step contravenes the absolute prohibition on statelessness and undermines the fundamental protections that citizenship is meant to provide.” Unlawful&nbsp; In &nbsp;2023, the Israeli parliament passed a law allowing the government to rescind the citizenship or permanent residency of Palestinians accused of committing “acts of terror” and deport them to the occupied West Bank or the Gaza Strip. The decision on Tuesday is the first application of a legislation.&nbsp; It applies to both Palestinian citizens of Israel and permanent residents of occupied East Jerusalem, the latter who widely refuse Israeli citizenship and are issued residency IDs by Israel’s interior ministry. &nbsp; Legal experts&nbsp; told &nbsp;Middle East Eye near the time of the law's approval that the policy amounts to a war crime and contravenes international law.&nbsp; Removing Palestinian permanent residents of Jerusalem, who are protected persons under international humanitarian law according to the Fourth Geneva Convention, “amounts to a grave breach of that convention and thus to a war crime”, Saba Pipia, legal adviser at the&nbsp; Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Center &nbsp;in Jerusalem, explained. In addition, compelling Palestinians in Jerusalem to show loyalty to Israel also falls foul of international humanitarian law.&nbsp; “Article 45 of the Hague Regulations prohibits the occupying power from compelling inhabitants of the occupied territory to swear allegiance to it,” said Pipia. “Therefore, Palestinian residents of Jerusalem are not obliged to be loyal to the State of Israel, the occupying power.” The Israeli Supreme Court has previously acknowledged that the existing revocation law, which could render people stateless, contradicts international law, but ruled that such violations are not domestically unconstitutional. The law has been&nbsp; criticised &nbsp;by rights groups as discriminatory, on the grounds that it creates separate legal tracks for citizenship based on racial identity.

Photograph: NSW Police DNA technology used to catch Golden State Killer leads to NSW arrest over historic alleged sexual assaults Police charge Kempsey man for alleged attacks between 1991 and 2002 Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast Sex crimes detectives have used emerging DNA technology to arrest an elderly man for a series of alleged sexual assaults dating back more than 30 years in a first for New South Wales police. Robert Wayne Kwan, 77, was arrested after detectives issued a search warrant in South Kempsey on the NSW north coast on Wednesday. Kwan faced court on Thursday on nine sexual assault and several kidnapping charges. Police allege Kwan was responsible for three attacks over 11 years, involving an 11-year-old girl in Sydney’s west in 1991, a 16-year-old girl in the Illawarra in 1996, and a 26-year-old woman in Dubbo in 2002. NSW police used forensic investigative genetic genealogy (Figg) to compare DNA profiles from multiple crimes to match genetic profiles – the same technique used in 2018 to identify the Golden State Killer in the United States. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Unlike traditional forensic profiling, which looks at 21 genetic markers, the Figg process examines hundreds of thousands of genetic markers to identify familial connections as distant as fourth cousins. DNA markers are compared against two publicly available genealogy databases, GEDmatch PRO and FamilyTreeDNA, which allow law enforcement access to consenting profiles for use in solving serious crimes. NSW detectives started using the technology in 2022 to review unsolved sex crimes and were allegedly able to link three cases to a single male profile. In the first case, an 11-year-old girl was allegedly approached in March 1991 by an unknown man in the Sydney suburb of Glendenning, who ushered her into his car after offering her a lift. The man allegedly sexually assaulted her and then dropped her at Mount Druitt railway station. In February 1996, a 16-year-old girl accepted a lift from an unknown man in Kanahooka in Wollongong. He allegedly sexually assaulted her and dropped her in Warrawong. In December 2002, a 26-year-old woman accepted a lift from an unknown man near the Commercial Hotel in Dubbo who allegedly sexually assaulted her. Each of the three alleged attacks was reported and DNA samples were collected. After DNA analysis confirmed the assaults were linked by the same male DNA profile, police uploaded it to the public genealogy databases, identifying a close relative of the attacker and eventually narrowing their search to Kwan. It is the first arrest triggered by the technology in NSW. The sex crimes squad commander, Det Supt Jayne Doherty, urged the public to consider “opting in” on genealogy websites to allow law enforcement to compare profiles. She said such access is used only for the most serious victim-based offences such as homicides, sexual assaults or to identify human remains. According to Doherty, other Australian states are using the technology and a previous arrest using the method was made in Western Australia. “No matter how much time has passed, our detectives continue to pursue every available avenue to identify those responsible for sexual assaults like this.” Kwan did not apply for bail and will return to Kempsey local court on 22 April.

      "content": "Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Telegram Email Reddit Researchers show that ordinary WiFi signals can be used to create camera-like images of people in their surroundings, even if those people are not carrying active devices. Credit: Shutterstock Researchers say a new technology can identify individuals even when they are not carrying a WiFi device by passively recording signals in radio networks, raising serious privacy concerns and prompting calls for stronger protections. Walking past a caf&eacute; with an active WiFi network could be enough for you to be identified, even if you are not carrying a cell phone. Researchers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have shown that people can be recognized solely by recording WiFi communication in their surroundings, a capability they warn poses a serious threat to personal privacy. The method does not require individuals to carry any electronic devices, nor does it rely on specialized hardware. Instead, it makes use of ordinary WiFi devices already communicating with each other nearby. As radio waves move through a space and interact with people, they create distinctive patterns that can be captured and analyzed. These patterns are comparable to images produced by cameras, but they are formed using radio signals rather than light. The research team argues that this emerging capability highlights the urgent need for stronger privacy protections. &ldquo;By observing the propagation of radio waves, we can create an image of the surroundings and of persons who are present,&rdquo; says Professor Thorsten Strufe from KASTEL (KIT&rsquo;s Institute of Information Security and Dependability). &ldquo;This works similar to a normal camera, the difference being that in our case, radio waves instead of light waves are used for the recognition,&rdquo; explains the cybersecurity expert. &ldquo;Thus, it does not matter whether you carry a WiFi device on you or not.&rdquo; Turning off your own device offers no protection, he adds, because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s sufficient that other WiFi devices in your surroundings are active.&rdquo; WiFi Routers as &ldquo;Quiet Observers&rdquo; &ldquo;This technology turns every router into a potential means for surveillance,&rdquo; warns Julian Todt from KASTEL. &ldquo;If you regularly pass by a caf&eacute; that operates a WiFi network, you could be identified there without noticing it and be recognized later, for example by public authorities or companies.&rdquo; Felix Morsbach notes that intelligence agencies or cybercriminals currently have simpler ways to monitor people, such as accessing CCTV systems or video doorbells. &ldquo;However, the omnipresent wireless networks might become a nearly comprehensive surveillance infrastructure with one concerning property: they are invisible and raise no suspicion.&rdquo; WiFi networks are now found in most homes, offices, restaurants, and public spaces. No Special Hardware Require Unlike attacks that rely on LIDAR sensors or earlier WiFi-based techniques that use channel state information (CSI), meaning measurements of how radio signals change when they reflect off walls, furniture, or people, this approach does not require specialized equipment. Instead, it can be carried out using a standard WiFi device. The method takes advantage of normal network communication between connected devices and the router. These devices regularly send feedback signals within the network, known as beamforming feedback information (BFI), which are transmitted without encryption and can be read by anyone within range. By collecting this data, images of people can be generated from multiple perspectives, allowing individuals to be identified. Once the machine learning model has been trained, the identification process takes only a few seconds. Almost 100% Accuracy &ndash; Technology Entails Risks to Privacy In a study with 197 participants, the team could infer the identity of persons with almost 100% accuracy &ndash; independently of the perspective or their gait. &ldquo;The technology is powerful, but at the same time entails risks to our fundamental rights, especially to privacy,&rdquo; emphasizes Strufe. The researchers warn that this is particularly critical in authoritarian states where the technology might be used for the observation of protesters. Therefore, they urgently call for protective measures and privacy safeguards in the forthcoming IEEE 802.11bf WiFi standard.

The Sudan Doctors Network said the attack was carried out at dawn on Wednesday by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group engaged in a three-year civil war with the Sudanese Armed Forces. The children were reportedly studying the Quran at the Sheikh Ahmed al-Badawi Mosque in North Kordofan State when the building was hit by a drone in a “blatant violation of international humanitarian law and a grave assault on places of worship”, the doctors’ group said in a Facebook post. “Targeting children inside mosques is a fully constituted crime that cannot be justified under any pretext and represents a dangerous escalation in the pattern of repeated violations against civilians,” the doctors said. The Sudan Doctors Network said the RSF has previously targeted other religious buildings for attack, including a church in Khartoum and another mosque in el-Fasher, reflecting a “systematic pattern that shows clear disregard for the sanctity of life and religious sites”. “The network calls on the international community, the United Nations, and human rights and humanitarian organizations to take urgent action to pressure for the end to the targeting of civilians, ensure their protection, open safe corridors for the delivery of medical and humanitarian aid, and work to document these violations and hold those responsible accountable,” it said. The UN separately said on Wednesday that a recent series of drone attacks have been reported on civilian infrastructure in Sudan’s South Kordofan, North Kordofan and West Kordofan states. A World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in Kadugli was also hit by a suspected rocket attack on Tuesday night, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. He did not say which group was responsible for the attack. “The fact that we have to reiterate almost every day that civilians and civilian infrastructure, places of worship, schools and hospitals cannot and should not be targeted is a tragedy in itself,” Dujarric told reporters. The UN has warned that Sudan’s civil war is expanding from western Darfur into the Kordofan region. It has documented more than 90 civilian deaths and 142 injuries caused by drone strikes between the end of January and February 6, which were carried out by the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces. Targets included a WFP convoy, markets, health facilities and residential neighbourhoods in southern and northern Kordofan, the UN said.",

Police allege Robert Wayne Kwan, 77, was responsible for three attacks over 11 years. Photograph: NSW Police DNA technology used to catch Golden State Killer leads to NSW arrest over historic alleged sexual assaults Police charge Kempsey man for alleged attacks between 1991 and 2002 Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast Sex crimes detectives have used emerging DNA technology to arrest an elderly man for a series of alleged sexual assaults dating back more than 30 years in a first for New South Wales police. Robert Wayne Kwan, 77, was arrested after detectives issued a search warrant in South Kempsey on the NSW north coast on Wednesday. Kwan faced court on Thursday on nine sexual assault and several kidnapping charges. Police allege Kwan was responsible for three attacks over 11 years, involving an 11-year-old girl in Sydney’s west in 1991, a 16-year-old girl in the Illawarra in 1996, and a 26-year-old woman in Dubbo in 2002. NSW police used forensic investigative genetic genealogy (Figg) to compare DNA profiles from multiple crimes to match genetic profiles – the same technique used in 2018 to identify the Golden State Killer in the United States. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Unlike traditional forensic profiling, which looks at 21 genetic markers, the Figg process examines hundreds of thousands of genetic markers to identify familial connections as distant as fourth cousins. DNA markers are compared against two publicly available genealogy databases, GEDmatch PRO and FamilyTreeDNA, which allow law enforcement access to consenting profiles for use in solving serious crimes. NSW detectives started using the technology in 2022 to review unsolved sex crimes and were allegedly able to link three cases to a single male profile. In the first case, an 11-year-old girl was allegedly approached in March 1991 by an unknown man in the Sydney suburb of Glendenning, who ushered her into his car after offering her a lift. The man allegedly sexually assaulted her and then dropped her at Mount Druitt railway station. In February 1996, a 16-year-old girl accepted a lift from an unknown man in Kanahooka in Wollongong. He allegedly sexually assaulted her and dropped her in Warrawong. In December 2002, a 26-year-old woman accepted a lift from an unknown man near the Commercial Hotel in Dubbo who allegedly sexually assaulted her. Each of the three alleged attacks was reported and DNA samples were collected. After DNA analysis confirmed the assaults were linked by the same male DNA profile, police uploaded it to the public genealogy databases, identifying a close relative of the attacker and eventually narrowing their search to Kwan. It is the first arrest triggered by the technology in NSW. The sex crimes squad commander, Det Supt Jayne Doherty, urged the public to consider “opting in” on genealogy websites to allow law enforcement to compare profiles. She said such access is used only for the most serious victim-based offences such as homicides, sexual assaults or to identify human remains. According to Doherty, other Australian states are using the technology and a previous arrest using the method was made in Western Australia. “No matter how much time has passed, our detectives continue to pursue every available avenue to identify those responsible for sexual assaults like this.” Kwan did not apply for bail and will return to Kempsey local court on 22 April.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minnesota is pushing the United States court system to its breaking point. Since Operation Metro Surge began in December, federal immigration agents have arrested some 4,000 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The result is an avalanche of cases filed in the US district court in Minnesota on behalf of people challenging their imprisonment by federal immigration enforcement agents. According to WIRED&#x27;s review of court records and official judicial statistics, attorneys filed nearly as many so-called habeas corpus petitions in Minnesota alone as were filed across the US during an entire year. The bombardment of cases filed in federal court in Minnesota and other states is the result of two Trump administration policies: a dramatic increase in the number of people being detained, and the elimination of a key legal mechanism for securing their release. The result is a US court system in collapse: Judges, immigration attorneys, and federal prosecutors are all overwhelmed, while the people at the center of these cases remain behind bars, often in states thousands of miles from their home—many after judges have ordered their release. “I’ve never said the word habeas so many times in my life,” says Graham Ojala-Barbour, a Minnesota immigration attorney who has been practicing for over a decade. Ojala-Barbour says that when he goes to sleep, his dreams are about habeas petitions. Exhaustion is endemic. On February 3, one now-former special assistant US attorney, Julie Le, begged a US judge in Minnesota to hold her in contempt so she could finally rest. She was listed on 88 cases, according to data obtained via PACER, the US court records database. Daniel Rosen, the US attorney for the district of Minnesota and head of Le’s office, previously told that judge in a letter that they were “struggling to keep up with the immense volume” of petitions and had let at least one court order demanding the return of a petitioner slip through the cracks. Le did not respond to a request for comment. In response to a request for comment, the Minnesota US Attorney’s Office sent an automatic reply stating that they currently lacked a public information officer. Le was reportedly fired after the February hearing, where she told the judge, “This job sucks.” In response to a request for comment, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, “The Trump administration is more than prepared to handle the legal caseload necessary to deliver President Trump’s deportation agenda for the American people.” As hard as the workload may be for US attorneys, the situation is far more dire for people detained by immigration authorities. In court filings, people who have been detained describe being packed into cells that were so full that they couldn’t even sit down before being flown to detention centers in Texas. One described having to share cells with people who were sick with Covid. Others said agents repeatedly pressured them and other detainees to self-deport. McLaughlin told WIRED, “All detainees are provided with proper meals, water, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. All detainees receive full due process.” civil division chief for the Minnesota US Attorney’s Office, has been listed as one of the attorneys defending the government in nearly all the habeas petition cases filed in Minnesota since Operation Metro Surge began. Before December, the majority of cases associated with Voss were about other issues, such as social security and disability lawsuits. Since then, habeas petitions for immigrant detainees have dramatically overtaken all other matters. In January, 584 of the 618 cases filed in Minnesota district court that included Voss as an appearing attorney were categorized as habeas petitions for detainees, according to a WIRED review of PACER data. This is likely an undercount due to incorrect “nature of suit” labels. Voss is no longer with the Minnesota US Attorney’s Office, according to an automatic reply from her Department of Justice email address. The number of habeas petitions filed has exploded in other parts of the country as well. In the western district court of Texas, for example, at least 774 petitions were filed in the month of January, according to data collected by Habeas Dockets. In the Middle District of Georgia, 186 petitions were filed that same month. ProPublica reported that across the country, there have been over 18,000 habeas cases filed since January 2025. that between April 2024 and the end of March 2025, attorneys had filed just 618 habeas petitions for noncitizen detainees throughout the entire federal court system. Several factors have contributed to the rise in habeas cases, according to attorneys who have represented both the federal government and detainees. One is that there are simply far more people in detention than there ever have been. Over 70,000 people are in detention as of January 25, according to the most recent available data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Toward the end of the Biden administration, there were less than 15,000. Sarah Wilson, an attorney who previously worked in the Justice Department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, says that increases in habeas petition cases tend to track with increases in the number of people detained. The Trump administration has also pushed a new interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act that departs from decades of case law and expands the categories of people being detained without parole. Previously, undocumented immigrants who had been living in the country for several years were typically given a bond hearing in front of an immigration judge. Those judges were supposed to weigh the facts of a detainee’s case, including their criminal history and relative flight risk, and make a decision about their release while their cases were pending. Got a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about US immigration or the US court system? We&#x27;d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mvarner.01. That is no longer the case. Now, Wilson says, filing a habeas petition “really has become the only avenue for restoring that right to a bond hearing that had previously existed.” McLaughlin told WIRED, “It should come as no surprise that more habeas petitions are being filed by illegal aliens—especially after many activist judges have attempted to thwart President Trump from fulfilling the American people&#x27;s mandate for mass deportations.” On February 6, the Fifth Circuit of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration’s new legal interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That ruling may complicate many detainees’ path to a bond hearing, since the majority of detainees are currently being held in detention facilities in Texas, where the Fifth Circuit’s ruling applies. Ojala-Barbour, the Minnesota immigration attorney, says that habeas petition cases are typically filed in the district court where a detainee is currently located. WIRED found more than two dozen habeas petition cases originally filed in Minnesota that were transferred to different courts. In at least two instances, the government argued that cases should be transferred to Texas courts because a petitioner had been moved to a detention facility there. McLaughlin said that ICE makes custody determinations based on bed space. Despite the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, hundreds of cases in other jurisdictions have resulted in rulings against the government’s new position. The chief judge for the Middle District of Georgia has referred to the volume of petitions as an “administrative judicial emergency.” defending the government in habeas petition cases, US attorneys are also supposed to ensure that the government complies with any court orders that result from those cases, including orders to release and return petitioners to their home states. When these attorneys fail to enforce court orders because they are overwhelmed or underprepared, it can mean that people remain in detention for longer than they should be. Le, the former special assistant US attorney in Minnesota, told the judge that she had volunteered to help the Minnesota US Attorney’s Office with habeas petition cases, but described a messy onboarding process that seems to have left her underprepared to handle the dozens of habeas petitions she was assigned. Le conceded to the judge that she hadn’t received proper orientation or training, and had to figure out what to do on the job. She said that she had been working for a month before she finally received an employee badge and was still having trouble accessing her new work email. Court records show she had been added to cases before she was admitted to practice in Minnesota, and someone else had to file briefs on her behalf. Before she started at the US Attorney’s Office, Le said, she worked at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#x27;s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor. It’s hard to underscore how different being an attorney at OPLA versus the USAO’s office can be. OPLA attorneys represent DHS in front of the immigration judges at DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review–not federal judges, who are in another branch of government entirely. Cases in immigration court are considered less formal, internal proceedings, where government attorneys get a lot of deference. Experts described the standards of evidence for federal court as much higher. Le told the judge that trying to get ICE to comply with court orders was like pulling teeth. Now, Le is reportedly no longer with the USAO’s office. Voss is also gone. Voss’ automatic reply identified David Fuller as the new point of contact for civil chief inquiries. In February, Fuller started being added to habeas petition cases in a similar manner to how Voss was. As of February 10, PACER data lists Fuller as an attorney in 183 habeas petition cases that were filed so far in February, double the amount of cases he is listed as appearing in that were filed during the entire month of January.

      "content": "Listen to this article | 4 minsinfoSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson walks through the halls of Congress on February 11 [Kent Nishimura/Reuters]By Al Jazeera Staff and News Agencies12 Feb 2026share2Share twitterwhatsappcopylinkThe United States House of Representatives has advanced a bill that would roll back President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a signal of growing willingness among Republicans to break with his administration. Wednesday’s vote saw several Republicans cross party lines to vote with Democrats. The final tally saw 219 votes in favour of ending Trump’s use of emergency powers to slap tariffs on Canada. A minority, comprised of 211 representatives, voted against the bill. It was a rare rebuke from Congress’s lower chamber, where the Republican Party holds a 218-seat majority. Before the vote, Democrats challenged their Republican colleagues to defy Trump, who has come to dominate the party. “Today’s vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J Trump?” said Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, who authored the resolution. The vote comes as the US enters its pivotal midterm election season. Primaries begin in March, and the general election unfolds in November. All members of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in their respective districts. Faced with Trump’s drooping approval rating, Republican representatives have faced the uncomfortable choice of either bucking his less-popular policies or remaining steadfast, despite possible blowback at the ballot box. Trump, meanwhile, threatened to derail the election prospects of any Republican who voted in favour of Wednesday’s bill. “Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries,” Trump wrote on social media in the lead-up to the vote. He also accused Canada – one of the US’s biggest trading partners and closest allies – of mistreating its southern neighbour. “Canada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years,” Trump said in a second post. “They are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border. TARIFFS make a WIN for us, EASY. Republicans must keep it that way!” Wednesday’s bill now heads to the US Senate, where it is likely to pass. That chamber had already passed similar legislation designed to curtail Trump’s Canada tariff, first in April and later in October of last year. But the legislation is unlikely to become law. Even if it passes the Senate, Trump is poised to veto the bill. Congress needs a two-thirds majority in each chamber to overcome a presidential veto. That would require substantial Republican defections, more than what happened during Wednesday’s vote. Still, polls have shown that Trump’s tariffs are largely unpopular with voters, who blame them in part for rising prices on a bevy of goods. On February 4, for instance, the Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of respondents disapprove of Trump increasing tariffs. Only 37 percent said they approved. Democrats hope that the growing dissatisfaction, along with anger over Trump’s aggressive mass deportation raids, will help them end Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Currently, the Supreme Court is also weighing the legality of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, after the president faced defeat in lower-court rulings. Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson had urged the Republican caucus to abstain from voting until the high court rendered its decision. But six Republican representatives, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, defied him to help bring the measure to the floor for a vote. “Why doesn’t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we’re an independent branch?” said Representative Bacon. “We should defend our authorities. I hope the Supreme Court does, but if we don’t do it, shame on us.”",

Saifuddin explained that while Chinese nationals are permitted visa-free entry for up to 30 days per visit, they are subject to a cumulative stay limit of 90 days within any 180-day window. “The provisions under this agreement do not grant continuous 90-day visa-free stays, unlike arrangements extended to certain other countries,” he said in a parliamentary written reply to Puchong MP Yeo Bee Yin. Advertisement Yeo had asked the ministry to outline the measures taken to ensure the 90-day visa exemption for Chinese nationals would not be abused to obtain projects or work in Malaysia, particularly in the construction, renovation and service industries. According to Saifuddin, before the agreement’s enforcement, Chinese nationals were permitted entry under the visa liberalisa­tion plan from December 1, 2023, which allowed visa-free stays of up to 30 days per entry without any cumulative annual limit. Advertisement “The policy refinements introduced through the agreement reflect the government’s more cautious approach in balancing traveller facilitation with strengthened border controls,” he said. He also said the government’s emphasis is that this facility is meant to apply strictly to social visits and tourism.

      "content": "TAMPA, Fla. — Amazon received approval Feb. 10 to deploy thousands more broadband satellites, weeks after seeking relief from a July milestone for its first-generation network after reaching only about 11% of the required deployment. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission authorized Amazon to deploy and operate 3,212 Gen 2 satellites between 590 kilometers and 630 kilometers above Earth, alongside 1,292 Polar spacecraft between 600 kilometers and 650 kilometers. The two systems are in addition to the 3,232-satellite Gen 1 network operating at similar altitudes to Gen 2, enlarging the company’s total constellation to 7,736 satellites. The FCC also authorized Gen 1 satellites to use higher-frequency V-band spectrum in addition to Ka-band, and allowed Amazon to exceed certain satellite power limits inside the United States, subject to conditions. The Gen 2 and Polar satellites are approved to operate across Ku-, Ka- and V-band frequencies. Rajeev Badyal, vice president of Amazon Leo, said in a LinkedIn post that the approval clears the way for more capacity, throughput and coverage, including over the poles. This is “especially important for big enterprise/gov customers who want max performance to move large amounts of data through our network,” he said, adding that more details would be shared later. More deadlines The FCC approval requires Amazon to deploy half of the Gen 2 and Polar satellites by Feb. 10, 2032, and the remaining three years later. The authorization also requires coordination with federal users in several bands and semiannual reporting on orbital debris mitigation, including conjunction events and disposal performance. Amazon currently has until July 30, 2026, to launch half of its planned 3,232 Gen 1 satellites, with the remainder required to be deployed by July 30, 2029. Last month, the company asked the FCC to either extend the deadline for deploying 50% of Gen 1 or waive it entirely after launching only 180 satellites since kicking off deployments in April, citing limited launch capacity. In the request, Amazon said it still expects to have the entire Gen 1 constellation in orbit by the 2029 deadline, following progress in satellite manufacturing and launch contracting. The FCC said its latest approval is without prejudice to Amazon’s pending request to extend or waive the July 2026 milestone. The next launch of Amazon Leo satellites is slated for Feb. 12 , when Arianespace is set to fly 32 spacecraft on its first mission for the company and the first launch using Ariane 6’s heavy-lift Ariane 64 configuration.
