The repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 “endangerment finding” was paired with the immediate elimination of greenhouse gas standards on automobiles. But it also places a host of other climate rules in jeopardy, including carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and methane leaks for oil and gas producers. Advertisement Legal challenges were expected to follow swiftly. “This determination had no basis in fact, had none whatsoever, and no basis in law,” Trump said at a White House event.

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav On Thursday, OpenAI released its first production AI model to run on non-Nvidia hardware, deploying the new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark coding model on chips from Cerebras. The model delivers code at more than 1,000 tokens (chunks of data) per second, which is reported to be roughly 15 times faster than its predecessor. To compare, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6 in its new premium-priced fast mode reaches about 2.5 times its standard speed of 68.2 tokens per second , although it is a larger and more capable model than Spark. “Cerebras has been a great engineering partner, and we’re excited about adding fast inference as a new platform capability,” Sachin Katti, head of compute at OpenAI, said in a statement. Codex-Spark is a research preview available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) through the Codex app, command-line interface, and VS Code extension. OpenAI is rolling out API access to select design partners. The model ships with a 128,000-token context window and handles text only at launch. The release builds on the full GPT-5.3-Codex model that OpenAI launched earlier this month. Where the full model handles heavyweight agentic coding tasks, OpenAI tuned Spark for speed over depth of knowledge. OpenAI built it as a text-only model and tuned it specifically for coding, not for the general-purpose tasks that the larger version of GPT-5.3 handles. On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, two benchmarks for evaluating software engineering ability, Spark reportedly outperforms the older GPT-5.1-Codex-mini while completing tasks in a fraction of the time, according to OpenAI. The company did not share independent validation of those numbers. Anecdotally, Codex’s speed has been a sore spot; when Ars tested four AI coding agents building Minesweeper clones in December, Codex took roughly twice as long as Anthropic’s Claude Code to produce a working game. The coding agent arms race For context, GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark’s 1,000 tokens per second represents a fairly dramatic leap over anything OpenAI has previously served through its own infrastructure. According to independent benchmarks from Artificial Analysis, OpenAI’s fastest models on Nvidia hardware top out well below that mark: GPT-4o delivers roughly 147 tokens per second, o3-mini hits about 167, and GPT-4o mini clocks around 52. But 1,000 tokens per second is actually modest by Cerebras standards. The company has measured 2,100 tokens per second on Llama 3.1 70B and reported 3,000 tokens per second on OpenAI’s own open-weight gpt-oss-120B model, suggesting that Codex-Spark’s comparatively lower speed reflects the overhead of a larger or more complex model. AI coding agents have had a breakout year , with tools like OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code reaching a new level of usefulness for rapidly building prototypes, interfaces, and boilerplate code. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have all been racing to ship more capable coding agents, and latency has become what separates the winners; a model that codes faster lets a developer iterate faster. With fierce competition from Anthropic, OpenAI has been iterating on its Codex line at a rapid rate, releasing GPT-5.2 in December after CEO Sam Altman issued an internal “code red” memo about competitive pressure from Google, then shipping GPT-5.3-Codex just days ago. Diversifying away from Nvidia Spark’s deeper hardware story may be more consequential than its benchmark scores. The model runs on Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3, a chip the size of a dinner plate that Cerebras has built its business around since at least 2022. OpenAI and Cerebras announced their partnership in January, and Codex-Spark is the first product to come out of it. OpenAI has spent the past year systematically reducing its dependence on Nvidia. The company signed a massive multi-year deal with AMD in October 2025, struck a $38 billion cloud computing agreement with Amazon in November, and has been designing its own custom AI chip for eventual fabrication by TSMC. Meanwhile, a planned $100 billion infrastructure deal with Nvidia has fizzled so far, though Nvidia has since committed to a $20 billion investment. Reuters reported that OpenAI grew unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, which is exactly the kind of workload that OpenAI designed Codex-Spark for. Regardless of which chip is under the hood, speed matters, though it may come at the cost of accuracy. For developers who spend their days inside a code editor waiting for AI suggestions, 1,000 tokens per second may feel less like carefully piloting a jigsaw and more like running a rip saw.

      "content": "Advertisement Artificial intelligence Tech China’s MiniMax releases cheap AI model ‘designed for real-world productivity’ Company says it is ‘first frontier model … delivering on the promise of intelligence too cheap to meter’ Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Vincent Chow Published: 10:11am, 13 Feb 2026 Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company MiniMax has released a new model “designed for real-world productivity”, hot on the heels of new releases from its domestic rivals in a frenetic week for China’s AI industry. The update to its M2 large language model comes as investor interest in smaller Chinese AI companies hits new heights, with global investors looking to capitalise on China’s rapid progress in AI beyond the traditional tech giants. Citing in-house benchmark scores, MiniMax said on Friday morning that M2.5 was its most powerful model yet, with performance matching leading models from the likes of American heavyweights Anthropic and OpenAI in key areas such as coding and search. Advertisement One of the model’s strengths was its fast and cheap speed due to the cost efficiency achieved at a model size of 230 billion parameters, unchanged from previous M2 model iterations, MiniMax said. “M2.5 is the first frontier model where users do not need to worry about cost, delivering on the promise of intelligence too cheap to meter,” the company said, adding that the model could be used continuously for an hour at a rate of 100 tokens a second for just US$1. Tokens are small chunks of data read or generated by a model. Advertisement MiniMax rival Zhipu AI rolled out a new flagship model, GLM-5, on Wednesday that doubled the size of its previous iteration to reach 744 billion parameters.

Double-digit jump in registration rate, boosted by policy and cultural tradition, offers modest upturn, but demographers are wary of weak fertility intentions Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Luna Sun in Beijing Published: 9:00am, 13 Feb 2026 Updated: 10:20am, 13 Feb 2026 China’s marriage registrations edged up in 2025, offering a glimmer of hope for the birth outlook this year, but analysts caution that deeper demographic headwinds remain entrenched and difficult to reverse without broader policy support. China recorded 6.76 million marriage registrations nationwide in 2025, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, marking a 10.8 per cent increase from a year earlier, or 657,000 more couples. The number of marriage registrations is closely watched in China, as it typically serves as a strong indicator of birth trends in the following year, with extramarital births still considered taboo in many parts of the country. Advertisement Last year’s modest increase in marriages came as China’s birth count plummeted to a record low of 7.92 million , having declined by about 10 million from its 2016 peak while slashing the total by more than half in less than a decade, as the country’s population shrank for a fourth consecutive year. The nation’s shrinking population, compounded by a rapidly ageing demographic, has proved problematic for Beijing’s efforts to revive economic growth. Economists and demographers have noted that, with a shrinking workforce and fewer workers to support each retiree, China risks weaker productivity gains; mounting pension and healthcare burdens; and a prolonged drag on domestic demand. Advertisement China’s total population fell by 3.39 million in 2025 to 1.4049 billion, from 1.4083 billion a year earlier, according to official data. By sheer numbers, that marked the steepest annual population decline on record, apart from during China’s devastating famine from 1959 to 1961.

      "content": "Advertisement North Korea This Week in Asia Politics Why Takaichi’s Japan election victory has sparked North Korea’s ‘childish’ fury North Korea has accused Japan of resurrecting its wartime ambitions by expanding its defence and pursuing security alliances Reading Time: 3 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Julian Ryall Published: 8:00am, 13 Feb 2026 Updated: 9:11am, 13 Feb 2026 North Korea ’s claim that Japan has breached a diplomatic “red line” by deepening security partnerships is less about Tokyo’s defence moves than about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s decisive victory at the polls, analysts say, as a weaker mandate could have pushed her to negotiate with Pyongyang. With a commanding majority secured in Sunday’s election, Takaichi now faces fewer domestic constraints as she signals plans to expand Japan’s defence cooperation with Western partners and potentially push ahead with constitutional revision. North Korea has responded with unusually sharp rhetoric. In commentary published on Wednesday headlined “Plotting to expand military alliances aimed at perfecting war capabilities”, the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper argued that, as a former wartime aggressor, Japan was barred from possessing a military or forming security alliances. Advertisement The article also repeated Pyongyang’s frequently used line that Japan was planning to resurrect its empire on mainland Asia, accusing Tokyo of “creating an environment favourable to realising its ambitions of overseas invasion by strengthening military collusion with global powers”. Plaintiffs, their lawyers and supporters gather outside the Tokyo District Court after it ordered North Korea to pay damages for luring Japanese to the North with false promises on January 26. Photo: AP Further underlining Pyongyang’s hostility towards Takaichi’s conservative administration, another state-run media ran a feature on Tuesday about atrocities allegedly committed by Japanese invaders in the 1592 Imjin War. Korea Central News Agency’s article reiterated descriptions of “brigandish” Japanese carrying out “unethical crimes … so hideous that they can never be pardoned”.

Hello from Munich, where your Situation Report coauthors are just barely hanging on after an arduous journey plagued by flight cancellations due to the Lufthansa strike . We’ll be on the ground at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel for this year’s Munich Security Conference (say hello if you are, too, especially if you’re NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte) with special daily pop-up editions of SitRep through Sunday. Alright, here’s what’s on tap for today. Europe plays defense as Washington waffles, a Munich check-in on the state of cyber , and some weird things happening in El Paso . Trans-Atlantic Trepidation Today’s SitRep lead author is trying not to read too much into the first advertisement he saw as he exited Munich Airport this morning championing “EUROPEAN DEFENSE” in all caps and promoting a new autonomous drone partnership between German defense tech firms Helsing and Hensoldt. The companies’ joint announcement is even more on the nose, touting “sovereign German and European technology architecture” that will “sustainably strengthen the defense capabilities and technological leadership of a democratic Europe through purely national technology and supply chains.” Self-reliance is clearly on European minds heading into this week’s conference—exactly one year after U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance shocked conference attendees in Munich with a lecture on sovereignty and defense burdens, and weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump shocked many of those same attendees in Davos, Switzerland, with a speech calling for the U.S. takeover of Greenland (before NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte engineered a détente ). Trump’s threat to the territorial integrity of a NATO ally (Denmark, which controls Greenland) is the “final nail in the coffin” for the alliance, said retired Gen. Richard Shirreff, who served as NATO’s deputy supreme allied commander Europe from 2011 to 2014. “By doing that, Trump has blown a hole through the concept of collective defense,” Shirreff said, “and in doing so it forces Canada and Europe to effectively say to America: ‘We want to maintain links with you, but we have to Europeanize and Canadianize the NATO alliance.’” (Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has made it clear that he shares at least a version of that sentiment.) Officials in Munich on Thursday didn’t quite go that far, but self-sufficiency was the name of the game. “We must be united,” Andrius Kubilius, the European commissioner for defense and space, told the Munich Security Breakfast—a conference event that aims to connect European defense start-ups with investors. “We have continental scale, a European scale,” Kubilius added. “We need to learn how to use this scale for massive innovation in defense.” “Primary responsibility.” The shift is also being spurred on actively by Washington, as evidenced by a speech by U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby—standing in for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth—at a NATO defense ministers’ meeting in Brussels on Thursday. “Europe must assume primary responsibility for its own conventional defense,” Colby said, adding that the United States will “continue to press, respectfully but firmly and insistently, for a rebalancing of roles and burdens” within the alliance. (He did, however, make clear that the U.S. nuclear umbrella over Europe would remain intact.) Some of that rebalancing is already happening, with NATO announcing earlier this week that the United Kingdom and Italy will take over the joint force commands in Norfolk, Virginia, and Naples, Italy, respectively, from the United States. But it’s exceedingly clear that the trans-Atlantic relationship is in a state of flux, and the next three days in Munich are likely to produce a mix of lamenting what is lost and figuring out what comes next. The 2026 Munich Security Report —a customary precursor to the conference—leans heavily into that theme, writing that “the world has entered a period of wrecking-ball politics.” “The most powerful of those who take the axe to existing rules and institutions is US President Donald Trump,” the report says, adding that in some cases such as heightened NATO defense spending targets, that upheaval has produced important results. “Yet, it is unclear whether destruction is really clearing the ground for policies that will increase the security, prosperity, and freedom of the people.” Let’s Get Personnel A U.S. federal court has sided with Sen. Mark Kelly in his fight against Hegseth, who had sought to demote Kelly from his rank as Navy captain and cut his retirement pay in retaliation for Kelly appearing in a video with several other lawmakers urging U.S. troops not to follow unlawful orders. Hegseth and the Pentagon “have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” the judge said in a Thursday ruling that temporarily blocked Hegseth from taking action against Kelly. On the Button What should be high on your radar, if it isn’t already. El Paso fiasco. Something strange happened in the city of El Paso, Texas, this week—we’re just not exactly sure why. Here’s what we do know: Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suddenly announced El Paso’s airspace would be closed for 10 days. The highly unusual move raised alarm bells, and not just because of the implications for commercial and emergency air travel in the area. The FAA reportedly made this decision unilaterally, without warning other parts of the federal government or local government officials. On Wednesday morning, the pause was lifted at the urging of the White House. But the explanations that have emerged since are all over the place, and don’t exactly paint a picture of a government that’s in sync. The Trump administration announced that the temporary closure was due to a Mexican drug cartel drone incursion. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X on Wednesday morning, adding that normal flights would resume. It’s not unusual for cartel drones to fly into U.S. airspace, but other accounts have undermined the Trump administration’s public claims about what occurred. Some reports suggest that the airspace closure was a result of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials firing an anti-drone laser that was loaned by the Pentagon without giving the FAA a proper heads-up. What’s more, these reports say that CBP officials fired the laser at a party balloon they mistook for a drone. Throwing further doubt on the Trump administration’s official account, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum at a press conference on Wednesday said her government had no information regarding drone activity at the border. As things stand, it’s hard to know precisely what happened—and lawmakers in Washington are pushing for more answers. “The conflicting accounts coming from different parts of the federal government only deepen public concern and raise serious questions about coordination and decision-making,” Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

Al Bello / Getty Images Cyber Concerns Another MSC side event SitRep found itself at on Thursday was the Munich Cyber Security Conference (MCSC), which gathered cyber officials and executives from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond—including delegations from Kenya and Japan. But all eyes remained on Washington, and the opening statements by U.S. National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross. As Rishi reported in FP’s latest print issue last month, allies around the world have been worried about U.S. engagement in collective cyberdefense, and the gaps it leaves for adversaries such as China and Russia to exploit. Cairncross sought to provide some reassurance—sort of. “I should be clear that ‘America First’ is not America alone. We are looking for partnership, we value partnership,” he said. “But there are conversations that we need to have that address hard choices.” Cairncross instead put the onus on U.S. allies. “We want that partnership and we want that to continue, but that’s not our choice,” he said. “America would do it alone, but that’s not the choice that we would make.” One former U.S. cyber official did sound a note of warning about pulling back. “In the United States, two friendly nations to our north and south, two large oceans to our east and west do not protect us from the malware, the attacks, the domain of cyberspace today,” retired Gen. Paul Nakasone, the former head of the National Security Agency and the U.S. military’s Cyber Command, said on another panel later in the day. “So if our nations are going to decouple, we do so at our own risk. We are much better working together, and so the idea of decoupling technology, decoupling information sharing—for someone that had done this in the public sector—is something I’m very concerned about.” Put on Your Radar Sunday, Feb. 15: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio departs the Munich Security Conference for a two-day trip to Slovakia and Hungary. Tuesday, Feb. 17: French President Emmanuel Macron is set to visit India, where he will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and participate in the AI Impact Summit. Wednesday, Feb. 18: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is scheduled to arrive in India for a state visit, during which he will also meet with Modi and attend the AI Impact Summit. Quote of the Week “I think for the American people, this is the worst thing that can happen.” —Vance while speaking to reporters on Wednesday, referring to the end of the New START U.S.-Russia nuclear treaty that the Trump administration allowed to lapse last week .
