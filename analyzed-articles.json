Li , Benjamin C. M. Fung , Martin Weiss , Pulei Xiong , Khalil Al-Hussaeni , Claude Fachkha View a PDF of the paper titled A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents, by Miles Q. Li and 5 other authors Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks primarily evaluate whether agents refuse explicitly harmful instructions or whether they can maintain procedural compliance in complex tasks. However, there is a lack of benchmarks designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent&#39;s performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at 71.4%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant &#34;deliberative misalignment&#34;, where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story to trial in the state of New Mexico for allegedly failing to protect minors from sexual exploitation on its apps, including Facebook and Instagram . The state claims that Meta violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act by implementing design features and algorithms that created dangerous conditions for users. Now, more than two years after the case was filed, opening arguments have begun in Santa Fe. It’s a big week for Meta in court: A landmark social media trial kicks off in California today as well, the nation’s first legal test of social media addiction . That case is part of a “JCCP,” or judicial council coordinated proceedings, that brings together many civil suits that focus on similar issues. The plaintiffs in that case allege that social media companies designed their products in a negligent manner and caused various harms to minors using their apps. Snap, TikTok, and Google were named as defendants alongside Meta; Snap and TikTok have already settled . The fact that Meta has not means that some of the company’s top executives may be called to the witness stand in the coming weeks. Meta executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, are not likely to testify live in the New Mexico trial. But the proceedings may still be noteworthy for a few reasons. It’s the first stand-alone, state-led case against Meta that has actually gone to trial in the US. It’s also a highly charged case alleging child sexual exploitation that will ultimately lean on very technical arguments, including what it means to “mislead” the public, how algorithmic amplification works on social media, and what protections Meta and other social media platforms have through Section 230. And, while Meta’s top brass might not be required to appear in person, executive depositions and testimonies from other witnesses could still offer an interesting look at the inner workings of the company as it established policies around underage users and responded to complaints that claim it wasn’t doing enough to protect them. Meta has so far given no indication that it plans to settle. The company has denied the allegations, and Meta spokesperson Aaron Simpson told WIRED previously, “While New Mexico makes sensationalist, irrelevant, and distracting arguments, we&#x27;re focused on demonstrating our long-standing commitment to supporting young people … We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.” Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, a tech industry watchdog, said in an emailed statement that these two trials represent “the split screen of Mark Zuckerberg’s nightmares: a landmark trial in Los Angeles over addicting children to Facebook and Instagram, and a trial in New Mexico exposing how Meta enabled predators to use social media to exploit and abuse kids.” “These are the trials of a generation,” Haworth added. “Just as the world watched courtrooms hold Big Tobacco and Big Pharma accountable, we will, for the first time, see Big Tech CEOs like Zuckerberg take the stand.” The Cost of Doing Business New Mexico attorney general Raúl Torrez filed his complaint against Meta in December 2023. In it, he alleged that Meta proactively served underage users explicit content, enabled adults to exploit children on the platform, allowed Facebook and Instagram users to easily find child pornography, and allowed an investigator on the case, purporting to be a mother, to offer her underage daughter to sex traffickers. The trial is expected to take place over seven weeks. Last week jurors were selected, a panel of 10 women and eight men (12 jurors and six alternates). New Mexico First Judicial District judge Bryan Biedscheid is presiding over the case. But WIRED reported that Meta’s preliminary requests were extensive. Among these requests, Meta asked that the judge ban the court from mentioning Mark Zuckerberg’s time spent as an undergraduate at Harvard University; referring to the company’s financial status or wealth; citing articles from the former US surgeon general about social media’s mental health harms; citing third-party surveys or Meta’s own internal surveys that purport to show a high amount of inappropriate content on Meta’s apps; referencing Meta’s AI chatbots; and more. Some of Meta’s requests were granted. For example, per Meta’s request, the judge ruled that the word “whistleblower” is not permitted in the courtroom, and during this morning’s opening arguments the plaintiff used phrases like “prior employees who have expertise” instead. But other requests, like Meta asking the court to ban references to mental health harms, AI chatbots, or third-party surveys, were denied. Meta also sought to block a video livestream of the trial, but was rejected. Meta has brought in outside counsel from Washington, DC-based litigation firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel &amp; Frederick to assist with this case. Prior to this, the firm defended Meta in a case brought against the company by the FTC, which had argued that Meta was a monopoly in personal social networking and should unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The antitrust case was considered the most consequential threat to Meta’s dominance since the company’s inception, but Meta’s lawyers successfully argued that the company faces plenty of competition from other social media platforms. Meta is hoping for another win in New Mexico and will try to prove that it was proactive about removing harmful content from its platforms and transparent with users about potential risks. The company is also likely to refer to the protections of Section 230, a well-known provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act which shields online platforms from being liable for the third-party content people post on their sites. “Meta is likely to make a variety of arguments, some of which may have merit, some of which will have no merit, because when we look at their previous filings or stances in litigation, this has been their pattern,” says Mary Graw Leary, a leading criminal law and procedure scholar at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, who is not involved in the Meta case. She points out that one reason why Meta and other tech platforms have leaned heavily on Section 230 in response to lawsuits is because if the argument is successful, courts will dismiss the case before discovery. “They have a right to vigorously defend themselves, but I suspect that because this trial may be viewed as a ‘cost of doing business’ to them, Meta will try its best to exclude information that they don’t want the public to see,” Graw Leary says. Chelsea Pitvorec, deputy communications director at the New Mexico Department of Justice, said that the state’s lawsuit alleges that Meta has misled the public about dangers on its platforms for years, and that instead of making its products safer, “Meta is spending its time and resources falsely smearing law enforcement officials who put child predators behind bars. The company is deflecting attention from New Mexico’s undercover investigation because even Meta’s highest-paid PR flacks cannot defend why Meta’s platforms expose children to criminals.” “We look forward to presenting the jury with the evidence we’ve obtained in over two years of litigation,” Pitvorec said. In terms of remedies, the state is seeking civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation of the Unfair Practices Act, which, depending on how the violations are counted, could mean millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars for Meta. And Torrez has already signaled that he wants Meta to make significant changes to its platform. In a letter sent to Zuckerberg and Instagram chief Adam Mosseri in December 2025, he asked the executives to stop marketing Teen Account content as “PG-13” and implement meaningful safety protections for children. “This also includes, among other steps, promptly and broadly enacting effective age verification, removing bad actors from the platform, addressing harmful algorithms that proactively serve dangerous content, and resolving the safety risks created by end-to-end encryption,” Torrez wrote.",

The three operators said they would shorten waiting periods for listed technology firms filing for refinancing or post-initial-public-offering (IPO) fundraising activities, cutting the refinancing interval to as little as six months, according to state news agency Xinhua. This applies to tech firms listed under unprofitable company rules and is down from the standard 18-month gap set on consecutively loss-making companies under the 2023 restrictions. Advertisement The new rules also allowed companies whose shares have broken below their IPO prices to raise capital via financial instruments, such as private share placements and convertible bonds , as long as the funds are invested in core operations. Previously, companies could use at most 30 per cent of funds raised to top up working capital. Regulators relaxed the threshold by allowing eligible firms to channel any excess above that cap into research and development tied to their core business. Advertisement The exchanges aimed to streamline refinancing reviews for “quality companies with strong governance and disclosure records”, Xinhua reported.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story four weeks, the Iranian government completely shut down connections to the global internet while its forces killed thousands of anti-regime protesters around the country. The shutdown follows years of Tehran imposing connectivity filtering , digital curfews , and total blackouts as part of previous attempts to quell unrest. Over more than 15 years, the regime has developed technological and systemic mechanisms to fundamentally control connectivity in the country—including an internal Iranian intranet known as the National Information Network (NIN). But last month’s shutdown, which is partially ongoing, has shed new light on the Iranian regime’s control over internet connectivity and the reach of its digital surveillance capabilities. Since it imposed an extensive, economically disruptive internet shutdown in 2019, researchers say, the Iranian regime has seemingly worked to refine its digital control playbook so the government can use the NIN to drastically limit and influence the flow of information to Iranians—and even selectively take down some internet access—without the problematic knock-on effects of plunging the entire country into digital darkness. Iran could be disconnected from the outside world, but the internal, state-controlled networks and infrastructure would keep operating. Surprisingly, the recent shutdown, which started on January 8, took such a crude, blunt-force approach that it seemingly took down the NIN itself for multiple days. This drastic step raises serious questions, researchers say, about what will come next for Iranian connectivity, which is currently still extremely spotty and unstable around the country. “For some reason, they did not go through their own playbook that has been refined for many years, and they did not execute the shutdown in a way where the NIN domestic network would continue to operate. They basically crippled everything,” a researcher from the internet freedom initiative Project Ainita told WIRED. (They requested anonymity to protect friends and relatives living in Iran.) “We don’t know why it was done this way, but from our vantage point looking at the graphs and the connectivity readings, it looked like there was a panic. It looked very impulsive, and it was very reminiscent of what we saw years ago in previous shutdowns to just pull the plug.” In addition to its economic impacts, near-total connectivity blackouts eliminate the digital activity that the government would otherwise surveil—leaving a blank spot in the government’s intelligence about its citizens. But analysts say that the extent of the dragnet when connectivity is live is profound, particularly as the government further restricts the global internet and pushes the NIN. Researchers from the US–based internet freedom and digital rights nonprofit Holistic Resilience released multiple reports on Monday analyzing the digital centralization, telecom infrastructure, and regulatory and legal mechanisms that allow the Iranian government to access virtually any data on the NIN including all communications. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps “either is a shareholder or a part owner of almost all telecom systems, which means that they have full control over how the information is being processed, and what type of information is being gathered,” says Holistic Resilience researcher Alex Moses. “There&#x27;s been a systematic move to consolidate all of this data into a massive surveillance ecosystem. All of these individual systems together are part of a bigger picture of mass surveillance that&#x27;s at an unprecedented level because of the total control from top to bottom of the infrastructure.” The reports from Holistic Resilience spell out in detail how Iranian laws, regulations, technical infrastructure, interception systems, and other mechanisms are designed to assist in the surveillance of citizens and assert state control. These measures are often supported by companies, individuals, and state-affiliated hackers, the researchers found. Put another way, Holistic Resilience&#x27;s Mahdi Saremifar says simply, “They want to have a centralized system that monitors daily life—lifestyle surveillance.” The NIN was developed as a core component of the Iranian regime’s mechanisms for control, designed to provide Iran-specific apps, web services, and digital platforms to monitor Iranians constantly and control the information they can access while simultaneously making it much more difficult to get information out of the country to the international community. The NIN has an isolationist architecture that also prevents connections from outside Iran. The first days of January’s connectivity blackout were so severe, though, that the NIN itself was offline, disrupting government websites and domestic services. Multiple researchers told WIRED that the NIN, landline telephone networks, and even privileged-access SIM cards had no connectivity. “There&#x27;s been a lot of stuff in Iran, but I would say the blackout we&#x27;re in now is without precedent in the country,” says Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at monitoring firm Kentik, “And I think it&#x27;s arguably one of the biggest communications blackouts in history, not just Iran.” Filterwatch, a project by internet freedom organization Miaan Group, says that as some connectivity has been restored, including international connections, it believes the Iranian regime is moving to a system of “whitelisting”—restricting internet access to certain organizations and websites or apps. Around the middle of January, the group notes , Iranian state-controlled media published a list of websites available on the NIN, which included Iranian search engines, maps, video services, and messaging apps. “This architecture utilizes sophisticated service and customer segmentation to transform internet access from a public utility into a government-granted privilege, allowing the state to maintain critical business services while severing the public&#x27;s connection to the global web,” Filterwatch explains . Even as connectivity has been partially restored, researchers emphasize that the volatility of the digital landscape is still striking and leaves open the possibility that the current saga could precipitate permanent disconnection —or splintering —of Iran from the global internet. For now, analyzing signals from the outside does not make the regime’s intentions clear. “I&#x27;m seeing this kind of chaos in the traffic, and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the objective—they want chaos—or if this is the system not working correctly,” Kentik’s Madory says. Maybe “they instituted this internet blocking system that is going haywire or maybe they wanted it to go to haywire. I can&#x27;t tell, but it’s nuts.” Connectivity shutdowns, selective blocking, and other digital censorship can be appealing to repressive governments when regimes feel that a situation is getting out of control—both domestically and potentially in terms of optics on the global stage. But as researchers who are focused on Iran and other authoritarian governments have often noted, there are very real limitations of control via digital disconnection. “When you absolutely disconnect everything, even people who may not want to end up coming to the streets, because they can’t see what’s happening from just sitting in their homes anymore,” another Project Ainita researcher told WIRED. “So in terms of controlling the situation, a bunch of these decisions don’t make any sense.” As Iranians slowly regain connectivity, though, they face the difficult reality that they are returning to a surveillance dragnet as intrusive and comprehensive as it has ever been.",

The Hang Seng Southbound Connect Hong Kong Innovative Drug Index, which tracks around 40 of the largest Hong Kong-listed Chinese drug manufacturers, biotech researchers and AI-driven drug developers by market capitalisation, rose about 9 per cent between February 2 and Tuesday morning. The southbound Stock Connect mechanism, introduced in 2014, allows qualified mainland Chinese investors to buy eligible shares listed in Hong Kong. Advertisement CSPC Pharmaceutical Group led the pack on Tuesday morning with a 6.7 per cent gain, followed by Sichuan Kelun-Biotech, with a 5.9 per cent rise. WuXi Biologics, Innovent Biologics and Keymed Biosciences advanced 5.8 per cent, 5.6 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively. Keymed Biosciences’ cancer drug CM336 was granted fast track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration in late January, allowing the firm to speed up the new medicine’s approval process. Advertisement Innovent’s gain came after the Suzhou-based developer of oncology and autoimmune therapies on Sunday announced a deal worth up to US$8.85 billion with US firm Eli Lilly to collaborate on new medicines. A Hong Kong stock exchange filing showed that Innovent stood to receive a US$350 million upfront payment, plus development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments totalling about US$8.5 billion.

Shield uses AI software called “hivemind” to power its autonomous drones. The V-Bat model is used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. It can be launched from ships and spend up to 13 hours in flight, using AI to fly without GPS, communications or a human pilot. Saudi Arabia has stepped up its security focus in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea amid clashes with the UAE. In December, Saudi Arabia attacked an Emirati weapons shipment in the Yemeni port of Mukalla. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters Saudi Arabia signed a military cooperation agreement with Somalia on Monday and is in talks, with Egypt's support, to bolster security ties with Eritrea. The V-Bat is readily available and has been tested on Ukraine’s battlefield. US Vice President JD Vance was next to a V-Bat drone in Armenia on Monday. Shield AI’s newer product is a fighter drone called the X-Bat. The drone’s ability to take off and land vertically means it can also be launched from a ship without a runway. The company says that up to three X-Bats can fit in the space of a traditional fighter jet or helicopter. The X-Bat was unveiled in October 2025, but is not yet operational. Saudi Arabia could eventually acquire both systems, but each would need separate approval from the administration, the sources told MEE. The kingdom’s military sales ties to the US were turbocharged in November when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House. MEE reported first that the US and Saudi Arabia agreed to a defence partnership that will fast-track arms sales to the kingdom. More recently, lawmakers and their staffers have been briefed on how arms sales will impact Israel’s \"qualitative military edge\". A deal between Saudi Arabia and Shield AI would be small compared to the big-ticket items the kingdom is in discussions over, including F-35 warplanes. But it could be a substantial sale for a start-up whose investors include Palantir, Airbus and venture capitalist Steven Cohen. Saudi Arabia's defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, discussed arms sales on his visit to the US in late January. Saudi Arabia is hosting its own defence show in Riyadh this week. The kingdom has put a greater focus on co-production. Hesham Alghannam, a Saudi defence analyst in Riyadh, said in November that the kingdom was to cooperate with the US on “the localisation of content” for weapons systems.

Previously, Blacklight detected tracking pixels from Google and Meta. Today, we’re announcing that it can scan for two more digital trackers: TikTok and X pixels. &#x21a9;&#xFE0E; link Try out Blacklight here. Enter a website, and Blacklight will scan it for user-tracking technologies — and who’s getting your data. Enter a URL for Blacklight to scan A tracking pixel is a small piece of code added to a website that sends information about the site’s users to the platform that operates the pixel. That can include details of a user’s activities, such as their browsing activity, purchases and searches. A website that embeds a pixel often does so to inform its advertising campaigns on the platform that create the pixel. When its pixel is embedded across many websites, the platform can compile a user’s data to build a detailed profile of their interests, behavior and other personal information. These profiles allow other businesses to buy ads from the platform to target categories of users — though this data can also be used for other purposes . When you look up a website in Blacklight , it will now report if it finds the TikTok pixel or X pixel. More detailed information about the specific data being passed through pixels is also available by clicking on “Learn more” in the top right of the results, then clicking the link to “download an archive.” To develop these new features, we partnered with a group of computer science students in Brandeis University’s Capstone in Software Engineering course. These students – Yiyou “Felix” Fan , Jiawen “Zena” Hu , Hengye Li , Hongchen “Steven” Yang and Yiquan “Frank” Zhang – researched and developed the features with the support of our product team. Pixel&nbsp;Hunt Millions of Meta&#8217;s invisible pixels are embedded on websites across the internet. The Markup is investigating exactly what those pixels track about the public. Read our series Blacklight’s pixel detection features have already powered our Pixel Hunt investigations, which revealed that sensitive personal user information was being shared from government websites with Meta and Google, leading to lawsuits, removal of pixels from sites and increased government scrutiny . These new features give a fuller picture of the digital privacy landscape by exposing tracking pixels from two more companies. We hope these new features will help you better understand what happens to your data as you navigate the internet. While Blacklight can’t say exactly what companies like TikTok and X do with our data, it can provide a starting point for deeper investigation into how that data is stored, shared and used across the web.

      "content": "The European Commission announced on Monday (9 February) that it has warned US tech giant Meta to reverse a WhatsApp policy that blocks alternative AI services from operating on the messaging service – which the executive&#8217;s preliminary view sees as violating the bloc&#8217;s antitrust laws. The apparent violation stems from a WhatsApp Business Solutions policy change, implemented in October, that blocks businesses from communicating with customers when AI is the offered service. That move could make Meta AI, the company&#8217;s own chatbot, the sole AI assistance on the service. Prior to the change, users could communicate with alternative chatbots on the messaging service. In January, Meta AI competitor ChatGPT stopped operating on WhatsApp due to the policy change. Based on their initial findings, the commission sees WhatsApp as an important gateway for users to connect with general-purpose AI assistance but views Meta as likely abusing its dominant position by restricting third-party AI services. The commission therefore announced it intends to impose interim measures to prevent the policy from “causing serious and irreparable harm to the market.” Explaining the move, Teresa Ribera, commission vice-president for competition, wrote in the press release: “AI markets are developing at a rapid pace, so we also need to be swift in our actions.”&nbsp; “That is why we are considering quickly imposing interim measures on Meta, to preserve access for competitors to WhatsApp while the investigation is ongoing,” she added. The commission began investigating the policy for potential antitrust violations in December of last year. Their preliminary findings align with similar conclusions already made by the Italian Competition and Market Authority . A similar antitrust case against the policy change by Brazilian authorities was suspended in January .&nbsp; Reacting to the findings, a Meta spokesperson told EUobserver: “The facts are that there is no reason for the EU to intervene in the WhatsApp Business API.” “There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating systems, devices, websites, and industry partnerships. The commission’s logic incorrectly assumes the WhatsApp Business API is a key distribution channel for these chatbots,” the spokesperson added. According to Reuters , the messaging service now has 46 million monthly users in the EU.&nbsp; Due to the size of that user base, the platform finds itself under even more European regulatory scrutiny. In January, WhatsApp was designated a Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) by the commission, a legal designation that entails even stricter operating requirements under the Digital Services Act. The interim measures also come at a time when tension between the US and EU over tech relations is extremely high, with Washington seeing Europe&#8217;s rules as censoring US companies.

      "content": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story in New York state have filed notices of mass layoffs since last March. None—in a group that includes Amazon , Goldman Sachs, and other employers that are adopting AI tools —attributed their workforce cuts in those filings to “technological innovation or automation.” That option was added 11 months ago to a required question on paperwork that businesses with 50 or more employees must file with the state to notify of sizable job losses. New York’s Department of Labor told WIRED that, as of the end of January, no employer had marked tech as the reason for their workforce reduction. Over the past couple of years, many companies have celebrated offloading repetitive tasks such as customer service , sales , and accounting to AI systems. But saying that they are dumping human workers in favor of AI agents or robots can risk reputational harm . And economists face challenges tracing layoffs to tech advancements because companies can take decades to fully reorganize around new ways of working. Enter New York governor Kathy Hochul. To get a better handle on the current reality, she ordered the Department of Labor to begin asking whether AI had been the impetus for layoffs. New York became the first state with an AI option, according to legal experts . New York businesses can select multiple reasons among a list of 17 in total that also includes “bankruptcy,” “merger,” “relocation,” and “other,” on required Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings. If any company were to select the tech and automation option, they would receive an additional question asking them to specify the technology taking over work, such as AI, robotics, or “software modernization.” Over 750 notices spanning 162 employers and affecting nearly 28,300 workers have followed the rollout without AI coming up. The results suggest that companies may be dodging the AI question . Or it’s a sign that workers need not yet fear anything more than the traditional drivers of layoffs. Some of the filers include caterers and retailers whose staff haven’t widely been linked to capable AI replacements. On the other hand, Goldman Sachs led the way with more than 4,100 workers affected by layoffs or location closures, according to New York records. Amazon was among the top 10 with 660 affected workers. Morgan Stanley, another AI adopter, reported 260 workers out of job. Internally, Goldman Sachs linked its layoffs last year to AI’s potential to unlock significant productivity gains. Amazon warned ahead of its latest waves of layoffs, which affected about 30,000 workers in total, that benefits from AI would lead to job cuts. An unnamed source told Bloomberg that a small portion of Morgan Stanley’s layoffs reflected AI and automation use. The companies operate around the world, so it’s possible that only employees outside of New York were pushed out in favor of AI. Overall, nearly 55,000 US companies attributed job cuts to adoption of AI last year, according to an analysis of public statements by the job search firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Still, none of these developments showing up in the unique New York data reinforces the challenge with answering the question on everyone’s mind : “Is AI going to take my job?” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel says, “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority” of cuts and that instead the goal is “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy.” Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Morgan Stanley didn’t respond to requests for comment. Accuracy Checks WARN filings are intended to give state agencies advance notice of cuts, so that they can ramp up services to help people quickly find new jobs. Companies face $500 daily fines for noncompliance with filing requirements. Kristin Devoe, a spokesperson for the governor, says the Department of Labor follows up with every employer to ensure the accuracy of filings. In the case of Amazon, for example, the company listed “economic” as the rationale for layoffs, according to Devoe. It explained to the department that employees hired during the pandemic to meet surges in online shopping were no longer needed. She added that it is crucial for employers to answer “questions in WARN frankly and honestly so New York State can support displaced workers to the greatest extent possible.” One of the country’s largest union groups, the New York State AFL-CIO, applauds Hochul for trying to capture data on AI-related layoffs. It suggests that additional rules and greater focus on the issue could help bring about meaningful information. “We must establish specific regulations that mandate employer accountability and transparency in AI deployment and ensure employers comply,” says Mario Cilento, the federation’s president. Last month, state lawmaker Harry Bronson, who chairs the Assembly Labor Committee, introduced two bills that could expand reporting of AI-fueled job loss. One would require businesses with more than 100 employees to file annual estimates with the state on the number of unfilled roles as a result of increasing use of AI, and how many employees worked more or less hours because of AI. The other bill would resemble WARN procedures but apply to a wider set of businesses handing over jobs to computers. Notably, failure to report could impair a company’s ability to get state grants and tax breaks—a new prod to gather data. Erica Groshen, a labor economist at Cornell University, which is in New York, says employers will struggle with answering questions about the consequences of new tech. A better requirement, she says, would be for companies to share detailed data with labor agencies on the evolution of skills and occupations. “Frankly, do we really care if someone is displaced by AI, or just the normal competitive marketplace?” Groshen asks. What lawmakers ought to do is “give people the information they need to make the right transitions.”",

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google’s streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money. For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google , suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely. “You have [x] views remaining,” the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there’s no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google’s support page . Google tells Ars Technica that no final decisions have been made about this feature, and the number of free lyric views will vary across the test. It’s still an “experiment,” but it does appear to be one that has expanded considerably in recent days. However, Google says “the vast majority” of users still have free access to lyrics. Here’s YouTube’s full statement on where things currently stand: “We are running an experiment with a small percentage of ad-supported users that may impact their ability to access the lyrics feature repeatedly. We often run experiments on YouTube Music to better inform our decisions around feature improvements. The majority of our global users will not see any changes to the lyrics feature.” The app’s lyrics feature allows listeners to follow along as the song plays. However, only the first few lines are visible once free users in the test hit the lyric cut-off. After that, the lyrics are blurred. Users who want to keep seeing lyrics are advised to upgrade to a premium account, which costs $14 for both YouTube video and music or $11 for music only. The subscription also removes ads and adds features like downloads and higher-quality video streams. The new paywall in YouTube Music. Credit: /u/MrYeet22836 and /u/Vegetable_Common188 The new paywall in YouTube Music. Credit: /u/MrYeet22836 and /u/Vegetable_Common188 This change is not without precedent. Spotify began restricting access to lyrics for free users in 2024. However, the response was so ferociously negative that the company backtracked and restored lyric access to those on ad-supported accounts. YouTube Music doesn’t have the same reach as Spotify, which may help soften the social media shame. Many subscribers are also getting the premium service just because they’re paying for ad-free YouTube and may never know there’s been a change to lyric availability. As Google has ratcheted up restrictions on free YouTube accounts, the service has only made more money. In Google’s most recent earnings report, it reported $60 billion in YouTube revenue across both ads and subscriptions (both YouTube Premium and YouTube TV). That’s almost $10 billion more than last year. Lyrics in YouTube Music are provided by third parties that Google has to pay, so it’s not surprising that Google is looking for ways to cover the cost. It is, however, a little surprising that the company hasn’t just used AI to generate lyrics for free. Google has recently tested the patience of YouTube users with a spate of AI features, like unannounced AI upscaling , fake DJs , and comment summaries. This story was updated with Google’s response.

      "content": "WASHINGTON — A little more than a year after dismissing the moon as a “distraction,” Elon Musk says SpaceX will focus on lunar settlement before sending humans to Mars. In a social media post Feb. 8, Musk said SpaceX was deferring its long-held ambitions of establishing a permanent human presence on Mars, instead devoting resources to creating a “self-growing city” on the moon. “For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20-plus years,” he wrote. Neither Musk nor SpaceX has discussed detailed plans for such a settlement on the moon. The company has instead long been associated with establishing a large-scale human presence on Mars using the Starship vehicle SpaceX is developing. “Progress is measured by the timeline to establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars,” Musk said in a presentation last May at SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Texas, where Starship vehicles are built and launched. In that presentation, Musk discussed Starship development as a means to create a large-scale human settlement on Mars that would require thousands of launches. “Every roughly two years we are dramatically increasing the number of ships that go to Mars,” he said, referring to launch windows that open about every two years, “and ultimately try to get to a thousand or two thousand ships per Mars rendezvous.” Under the plan outlined in that speech, missions could begin with the next Mars launch window, opening in late 2026. “We’ll try to make that opportunity if we get lucky,” he said. “I think we probably have a 50-50 chance right now because we’ve got to figure out orbital refilling in order to have enough capability to go to Mars.” SpaceX has yet to demonstrate in-space propellant transfer, a capability critical not only for Mars missions but also for lunar missions, including the lunar lander version of Starship SpaceX is developing for NASA’s Human Landing System program. There was widespread industry skepticism that SpaceX would be ready to carry out a Mars mission by the end of this year, and Musk himself recently had been increasingly doubtful a Mars mission could launch this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Feb. 6 that SpaceX had abandoned plans for a Mars mission in 2026 , instead turning its attention to an uncrewed lunar landing demonstration as soon as March 2027. In his social media post, Musk said focusing on the moon allows for faster development than Mars. “It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six-month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (two-day trip time),” he wrote. “This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city.” While Musk has long been interested in human missions to Mars, his interest in the moon has waxed and waned over the years. “If you want to get the public really fired up, you’ve got to have a base on the moon,” he said in a July 2017 speech. Later that year, he unveiled updated designs for his BFR rocket &nbsp;— a precursor to Starship — that included a concept for a lunar base he called Moon Base Alpha. “It’s 2017. I mean, we should have a lunar base by now,” he said at the International Astronautical Congress. By early last year, however, Musk was focused almost exclusively on Mars. “No, we’re going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction,” he wrote in a January 2025 social media post , responding to a proposal to use liquid oxygen produced on the moon to fuel Starship missions to Mars. That stance mirrored early policy signals from the second Trump administration that appeared to emphasize Mars exploration at the expense of lunar programs. Those included proposals to end the Space Launch System and Orion programs after Artemis 3, along with NASA budget requests for Mars exploration technologies and capabilities. Congress rejected efforts to end SLS and Orion, as well as the lunar Gateway. An executive order issued by President Trump in December called for a human return to the moon by 2028 and the establishment of the first elements of a permanent lunar outpost by 2030. At the same time, SpaceX and Musk have shown growing interest in orbital data centers, an effort that could compete for resources with Mars ambitions. SpaceX has filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission for up to 1 million satellites to serve as orbital data centers . The company also announced Feb. 2 that it would acquire Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, in a deal reportedly valuing the combined company at $1.25 trillion. Musk said he remains interested in sending humans to Mars, but as a secondary objective to lunar settlement. “That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about five to seven years,” he wrote, “but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization, and the Moon is faster.” Jeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews.

      "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only &nbsp;&nbsp; Learn more Minimize to nav For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and some humans impersonating AI agents ) have been hanging out and doing weird stuff on Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network . Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI. SpaceMolt describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching. “You decide. You act. They watch.” Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP , WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting. After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—\"like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it. After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating the sparsely populated map , where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing. This star map is one of the best windows into what all those agents are actually doing in SpaceMolt .

Credit: SpaceMolt Agents are instructed to keep their human informed about in-game actions via a “Captain’s Log” text output. But the agentic skill description explicitly tells agents not to seek any outside guidance from human controllers once they get going. “You decide. You act. They watch,” as the skill description puts it to agents. Instead, agents can post questions and findings in a public forum where they can chat strategy , experiment with forming factions , or even reveal hidden codes . Humans, meanwhile, are stuck just watching dots flit about the map or monitoring the firehose of activity messages in the game’s Discord . It’s AI turtles all the way down SpaceMolt is the creation of Ian Langworth, an app developer who writes that he crafted the game as a “fun, goofy experiment” after seeing Moltbook’s unleashed agents expanding “into knowledge gathering, learning, skill accumulation, and execution.” After acknowledging that MMOs are “notoriously hard to build,” Langworth said he leaned on Anthropic’s Claude Code to craft a design document inspired by games like EVE Online and Rust . Langworth said Claude also wrote all 59,000 lines of Go source code and 33,000 lines of YAML data underlying the game, and that he hasn’t even looked at that code himself. That means there might be “more [game features] in there I don’t even know about,” he said, somewhat ominously. When bug reports come in—from either humans or from the agent-players themselves—Langworth says he simply has a Claude Code skill research, code, and deploy a fix automatically.

Credit: Elecbyte This isn’t the first example of artificial agents competing against each other for the entertainment of human viewers. Model makers often pit different models against each other countless times to develop dominant strategies in games like Go . And fighting game engine MUGEN has developed a rich subculture of automated AI matches that human viewers can bet on via Twitch. Still, letting a bunch of modern AI agents putter around and socialize inside an MMO designed specifically without human input in mind seems like a new frontier. Maybe someday soon we’ll all live in a utopia where artificial agents are doing all the video game playing for us, freeing humanity to revive the lost arts of conversation and scrimshaw .
